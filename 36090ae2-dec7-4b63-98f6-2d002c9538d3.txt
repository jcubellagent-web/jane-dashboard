So based on what we just did, Jane's mind, that widget should currently say that we just discussed what it would be like to add a voice to Jane, but still says discussing Claudo as 4.6 separated with Josh.
So, please, I'm curious why it did not upgrade. It's really getting frustrating that that's not upgrading as often as it needs to be asked after you do stuff.
Like, I would never know that you just helped me know what it would be like to set up a voice for you. Like, how am I supposed to know that?
