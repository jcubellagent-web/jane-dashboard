You can remove cold silver and NDX, so just show Bitcoin Ethereum and so on.
Please make it a little bit more visually appealing.
So put the Bitcoin logo in front of the Bitcoin sign, put the Ethereum logo in there,
but the Aslan logo in there.
And then tighten up the widget as small as you can make it
to the right of Jane status widget and then move the prediction markets widget back on your youth on the right side.
Thanks.
