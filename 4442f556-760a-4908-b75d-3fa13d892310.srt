Can you do me a favor and move this so rare NBA widget above Tik Tok stats and also I still don't think the stats are right

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,080
I don't even understand what the stats mean across the top

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,960
213-46-4 and 0. I don't know what that means

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,800
whatsoever and I don't know last completed

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:28,400
upcoming I can't really see any details so like if you can just double triple check that that'd be awesome. Thank you
