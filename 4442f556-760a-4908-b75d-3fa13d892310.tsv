0	8560	Can you do me a favor and move this so rare NBA widget above Tik Tok stats and also I still don't think the stats are right
8560	12080	I don't even understand what the stats mean across the top
12080	16960	213-46-4 and 0. I don't know what that means
17760	20800	whatsoever and I don't know last completed
20800	28400	upcoming I can't really see any details so like if you can just double triple check that that'd be awesome. Thank you
