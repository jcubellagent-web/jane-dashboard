00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
All right. That looks sick. All right. Now I really want you to like spend some time

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,640
going through this so rare application. Again, remember that I like to focus on playing

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:17,680
in the limited series championship matches, specifically the by weekly ones I believe.

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,200
So I usually play what say two to three teams and I'm going to have you set those teams

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:29,600
going forward. So if you can kind of just display to me, what you think the key information

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:36,080
is that I can consume it to understand, you know, when matches are ending, when new matches

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:42,960
are starting and what the scores are and what place I'm in for the matches that are getting close

8
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:50,000
to ending, that would be fantastic. So give that a shot. Let's see what you can do. Again, spend some

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,280
time like really thinking hard about what this should look like. I really wanted to be like a

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,280
premium part of this dashboard. Thanks.
