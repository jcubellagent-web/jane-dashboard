0	5600	All right. That looks sick. All right. Now I really want you to like spend some time
5600	10640	going through this so rare application. Again, remember that I like to focus on playing
10640	17680	in the limited series championship matches, specifically the by weekly ones I believe.
17680	23200	So I usually play what say two to three teams and I'm going to have you set those teams
23200	29600	going forward. So if you can kind of just display to me, what you think the key information
29680	36080	is that I can consume it to understand, you know, when matches are ending, when new matches
36080	42960	are starting and what the scores are and what place I'm in for the matches that are getting close
42960	50000	to ending, that would be fantastic. So give that a shot. Let's see what you can do. Again, spend some
50000	57280	time like really thinking hard about what this should look like. I really wanted to be like a
57280	59280	premium part of this dashboard. Thanks.
