All right. That looks sick. All right. Now I really want you to like spend some time

00:05.600 --> 00:10.640
going through this so rare application. Again, remember that I like to focus on playing

00:10.640 --> 00:17.680
in the limited series championship matches, specifically the by weekly ones I believe.

00:17.680 --> 00:23.200
So I usually play what say two to three teams and I'm going to have you set those teams

00:23.200 --> 00:29.600
going forward. So if you can kind of just display to me, what you think the key information

00:29.680 --> 00:36.080
is that I can consume it to understand, you know, when matches are ending, when new matches

00:36.080 --> 00:42.960
are starting and what the scores are and what place I'm in for the matches that are getting close

00:42.960 --> 00:50.000
to ending, that would be fantastic. So give that a shot. Let's see what you can do. Again, spend some

00:50.000 --> 00:57.280
time like really thinking hard about what this should look like. I really wanted to be like a

00:57.280 --> 00:59.280
premium part of this dashboard. Thanks.
