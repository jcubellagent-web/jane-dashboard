Now, that sounds awesome, and I'm going to take a look.
Also, this regarding the crypto web socket, according to dashboard ops, it just keeps
trying to reconnect.
It specifically says just over and over again, crypto web socket reconnecting dot dot dot.
So, I can just double check that that is up and running appropriately.
Thanks.
