Now, that sounds awesome, and I'm going to take a look.

00:04.000 --> 00:08.900
Also, this regarding the crypto web socket, according to dashboard ops, it just keeps

00:08.900 --> 00:10.620
trying to reconnect.

00:10.620 --> 00:16.740
It specifically says just over and over again, crypto web socket reconnecting dot dot dot.

00:16.740 --> 00:20.460
So, I can just double check that that is up and running appropriately.

00:20.460 --> 00:20.960
Thanks.
