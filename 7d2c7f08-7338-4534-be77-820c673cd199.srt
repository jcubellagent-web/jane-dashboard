1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
So, I was thinking instead of showing like the agents where currently says the agents

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,560
and identified and identified and identified with the James status widget, can we take

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,360
those out of the James status widget and move them in some clean way to the dashboard

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,360
ops.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,400
So that dashboard ops shows everything currently shows, but then also shows mismanformation

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,760
on any active agents that are running around the sub agents or Crohn's or anything

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,640
like that that might be, you know, being spun up or actively doing a job or something

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,640
like that.
