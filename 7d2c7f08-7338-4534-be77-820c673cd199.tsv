0	6120	So, I was thinking instead of showing like the agents where currently says the agents
6120	10560	and identified and identified and identified with the James status widget, can we take
10560	15360	those out of the James status widget and move them in some clean way to the dashboard
15360	16360	ops.
16360	20400	So that dashboard ops shows everything currently shows, but then also shows mismanformation
20400	24760	on any active agents that are running around the sub agents or Crohn's or anything
24760	29640	like that that might be, you know, being spun up or actively doing a job or something
29640	30640	like that.
