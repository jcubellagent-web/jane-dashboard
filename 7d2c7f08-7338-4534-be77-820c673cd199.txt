So, I was thinking instead of showing like the agents where currently says the agents
and identified and identified and identified with the James status widget, can we take
those out of the James status widget and move them in some clean way to the dashboard
ops.
So that dashboard ops shows everything currently shows, but then also shows mismanformation
on any active agents that are running around the sub agents or Crohn's or anything
like that that might be, you know, being spun up or actively doing a job or something
like that.
