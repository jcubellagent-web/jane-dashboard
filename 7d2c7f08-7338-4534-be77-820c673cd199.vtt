00:00.000 --> 00:06.120
So, I was thinking instead of showing like the agents where currently says the agents

00:06.120 --> 00:10.560
and identified and identified and identified with the James status widget, can we take

00:10.560 --> 00:15.360
those out of the James status widget and move them in some clean way to the dashboard

00:15.360 --> 00:16.360
ops.

00:16.360 --> 00:20.400
So that dashboard ops shows everything currently shows, but then also shows mismanformation

00:20.400 --> 00:24.760
on any active agents that are running around the sub agents or Crohn's or anything

00:24.760 --> 00:29.640
like that that might be, you know, being spun up or actively doing a job or something

00:29.640 --> 00:30.640
like that.
