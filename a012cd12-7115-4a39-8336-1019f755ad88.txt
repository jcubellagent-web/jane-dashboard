Can you double-check that cloud?
Opus 4.6 does not exist it literally seemed to take the market by storm today.
I think it was just released in the stock market literally like tanked because there was so much news about it.
So I just double-checked it doesn't exist at all.
And then let me know if it just doesn't exist or if you're not properly configured for it yet.
