Can you double-check that cloud?

00:03.000 --> 00:08.500
Opus 4.6 does not exist it literally seemed to take the market by storm today.

00:08.500 --> 00:14.500
I think it was just released in the stock market literally like tanked because there was so much news about it.

00:14.500 --> 00:18.000
So I just double-checked it doesn't exist at all.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.500
And then let me know if it just doesn't exist or if you're not properly configured for it yet.
