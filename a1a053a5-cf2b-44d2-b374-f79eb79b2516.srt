All right, that's helpful.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,240
Would you suggest I make any lineup chains for GWA

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,240
said in which charts in about 21 hours?

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,960
I bought some new players last night and just

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,440
want your thoughts enough I should swap any other night,

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,640
or if there's been any information that's changed that would

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,080
lead you to think that I should make some lineup changes.

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:20,880
Thanks.
