0	2320	All right, that's helpful.
2320	6240	Would you suggest I make any lineup chains for GWA
6240	8240	said in which charts in about 21 hours?
8240	10960	I bought some new players last night and just
10960	13440	want your thoughts enough I should swap any other night,
13440	16640	or if there's been any information that's changed that would
16640	20080	lead you to think that I should make some lineup changes.
20080	20880	Thanks.
