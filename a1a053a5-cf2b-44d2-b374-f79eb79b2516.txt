All right, that's helpful.
Would you suggest I make any lineup chains for GWA
said in which charts in about 21 hours?
I bought some new players last night and just
want your thoughts enough I should swap any other night,
or if there's been any information that's changed that would
lead you to think that I should make some lineup changes.
Thanks.
