All right, that's helpful.

00:02.320 --> 00:06.240
Would you suggest I make any lineup chains for GWA

00:06.240 --> 00:08.240
said in which charts in about 21 hours?

00:08.240 --> 00:10.960
I bought some new players last night and just

00:10.960 --> 00:13.440
want your thoughts enough I should swap any other night,

00:13.440 --> 00:16.640
or if there's been any information that's changed that would

00:16.640 --> 00:20.080
lead you to think that I should make some lineup changes.

00:20.080 --> 00:20.880
Thanks.
