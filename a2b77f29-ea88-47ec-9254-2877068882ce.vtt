All right. I think that's starting to look pretty good. Now double check the so

00:06.200 --> 00:11.440
rare MBA widget because you missed a lot. You're saying only have one card

00:11.440 --> 00:15.720
right now where I have many more. I know I have at least three line ups that you

00:15.720 --> 00:21.960
should remember roughly setting them. So just double triple quadruple check

00:21.960 --> 00:26.880
my so rare data and I only want you to build me a so rare widget if you

00:26.880 --> 00:30.800
actually think you can build me one that is good enough and can update on

00:30.800 --> 00:34.800
a regular basis and can basically make it so that I don't have to go into the

00:34.800 --> 00:39.360
so rare website and I can just tell you what I want you to do and I can just use

00:39.360 --> 00:44.240
this widget as basically my so widget for information that I need about

00:44.240 --> 00:49.440
so rare including wallet balance and all that type of stuff. Thanks.
