Make sure I should have more followers than 500.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,280
I just checked my TikTok and I have more than 500,

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,560
but I just refreshed the TikTok status app.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,480
And it still says I only have 500.

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,520
So I would have expected it to update when I clicked Refresh.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,720
Please let me know what was wrong and fix it.
