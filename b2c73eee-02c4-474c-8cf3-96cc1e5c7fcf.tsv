0	3560	Make sure I should have more followers than 500.
3560	6280	I just checked my TikTok and I have more than 500,
6280	9560	but I just refreshed the TikTok status app.
9560	11480	And it still says I only have 500.
11480	15520	So I would have expected it to update when I clicked Refresh.
15520	17720	Please let me know what was wrong and fix it.
