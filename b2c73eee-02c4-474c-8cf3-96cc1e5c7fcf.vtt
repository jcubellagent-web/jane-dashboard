Make sure I should have more followers than 500.

00:03.560 --> 00:06.280
I just checked my TikTok and I have more than 500,

00:06.280 --> 00:09.560
but I just refreshed the TikTok status app.

00:09.560 --> 00:11.480
And it still says I only have 500.

00:11.480 --> 00:15.520
So I would have expected it to update when I clicked Refresh.

00:15.520 --> 00:17.720
Please let me know what was wrong and fix it.
