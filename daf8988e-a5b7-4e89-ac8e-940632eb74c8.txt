That's more like it. Alright, I'm really liking where that's going.
Can you do some poking around the so-rare website?
I think there's a way for me to collect
Celtics based cards that I can start using some of the essence I have
to craft new cards.
Basically, I want you to figure out what I have to do to craft new cards
and then try and do that.
So let me know what you need for me once you can give me some more information.
