That's more like it. Alright, I'm really liking where that's going.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.000
Can you do some poking around the so-rare website?

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
I think there's a way for me to collect

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
Celtics based cards that I can start using some of the essence I have

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
to craft new cards.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
Basically, I want you to figure out what I have to do to craft new cards

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
and then try and do that.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
So let me know what you need for me once you can give me some more information.
