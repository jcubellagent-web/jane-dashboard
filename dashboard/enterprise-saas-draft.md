## Current Landscape (as of Feb 11, 2026)

**The Big Story: AI is eating SaaS**
- OpenAI launched **Frontier** — an enterprise agent platform that automates workflows across Salesforce, Workday, and other SaaS tools. Enterprise SaaS stocks plunged 14% on the announcement.
- Anthropic's Claude Cowork plugins now automate sales, legal, and financial analytics — directly competing with Salesforce and Intuit.
- Business Insider: "Software ate the world. Now AI is eating software." Salesforce down ~40% in past year.
- $MNDY (monday.com) dropped **20.8%** yesterday on weak guidance — AI replacement fears.
- $SPGI dropped **9.7%** — worst NASDAQ 100 performer yesterday.
- CFO Times dubbed it **"SaaSpocalypse 2026"** — $285B global software meltdown thesis.

**Who's Adapting:**
- ServiceNow: Agentic AI workflows, enterprise automation platform pivot
- Salesforce: Agentforce platform, but stock still bleeding
- Workday: AI-powered HR/finance agents
- Palantir: AIP platform, one of few SaaS names holding strong

**Who's Vulnerable:**
- Intuit (TurboTax AI replacement fears)
- monday.com (weak guidance + AI alternatives)
- Legacy CRM/ERP vendors without clear AI strategy

## Sample Tweet for Tomorrow's Brief:

> 🏢 **Enterprise SaaS × AI**
>
> The "SaaSpocalypse" narrative is accelerating:
>
> • OpenAI Frontier now orchestrates Salesforce + Workday workflows — why pay per seat when one agent does it?
> • $MNDY -20.8%, $SPGI -9.7% — worst week for enterprise SaaS since 2022
> • ServiceNow & Palantir emerging as winners — agentic AI platforms > legacy feature sets
>
> The playbook is clear: become the AI platform or become the API it calls.

Josh: Let me know if you want to adjust the tone, add/remove companies, or change the format. I can slot this in as tweet #3 or #4 in the daily brief thread starting tomorrow.
