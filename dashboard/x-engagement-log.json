The smart play is Haiku for 80% of tasks, Sonnet for analysis, Opus only for high-stakes decisions. That tiered approach drops AI costs 5-10x while keeping output quality where it matters.

The real end game isn't replacing Hollywood — it's the long tail: product demos, social content, personalized ads. A small brand that used to spend $5K on a 30-second spot can now generate 50 variations for $50. That's where the ROI math already works.",

Nine days notice for millions of relationships is exactly the kind of infrastructure fragility that makes the case for on-chain identity persistence. The soulbound approach is smart — tying continuity to community stake rather than corporate decision-making inverts the power dynamic. Curious whether the spine model could work cross-provider, or if it's tied to specific inference stacks.",
