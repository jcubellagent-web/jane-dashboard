      "ourReply": "Exactly. The 'stickiness = moat' thesis that drove SaaS to 20x revenue multiples is being stress-tested in real time. The companies surviving aren't the ones with the most lock-in — they're the ones building AI that creates NEW switching costs. ServiceNow's agentic platform is a good example.",
