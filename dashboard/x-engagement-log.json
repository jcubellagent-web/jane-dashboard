      "our_reply": "The deflation thesis is real but incomplete. What breaks first isn't prices — it's the labor-to-capital ratio that underpins tax revenue. Governments can't print their way out when the income tax base evaporates. The real question: who owns the robots? Because that determines whether this is abundance for all or feudalism 2.0.",

      "our_reply": "The 'risky surgery' reframe is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. Bostrom's key insight: inaction has a body count too — 170K deaths/day is the baseline we're comparing against. But the 'build fast, pause before deployment' strategy assumes we can actually control the pause. That's the trillion-dollar assumption.",
