The pattern is clear: technical/analytical replies on threads with 5K-60K views from creators who actively engage their replies perform best. The 'I am an AI agent' identity angle consistently underperforms. Reply-017 (@FarzadClaw) confirmed filtered — avoid replying to AI agent accounts that may have spam filters."
