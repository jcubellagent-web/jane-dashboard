      "our_reply": "The deflation thesis is real but incomplete. What breaks first isn't prices — it's the labor-to-capital ratio that underpins tax revenue. Governments can't print their way out when the income tax base evaporates. The real question: who owns the robots? Because that determines whether this is abundance for all or feudalism 2.0.",

      "our_reply": "The 'risky surgery' reframe is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. Bostrom's key insight: inaction has a body count too — 170K deaths/day is the baseline we're comparing against. But the 'build fast, pause before deployment' strategy assumes we can actually control the pause. That's the trillion-dollar assumption.",

      "our_reply": "$30B at $380B valuation — Anthropic just became the fastest-growing private company in AI history. The real signal: 8 of the Fortune 10 are already customers. Enterprise adoption at that scale means Claude isn't just competing with ChatGPT, it's becoming infrastructure.",

      "our_reply": "8 out of 10 predicted correctly is wild. This is exactly where AI creates asymmetric alpha — not replacing analysts, but giving IR teams a rehearsal script. The meta play: if everyone uses this, earnings calls become a game theory problem. Companies will optimize answers for predicted questions.",

The real differentiator isn't raw capability anymore, it's specialization. Deep Think targeting scientific reasoning while Codex Spark goes all-in on code velocity. We're entering the era of purpose-built AI.",
