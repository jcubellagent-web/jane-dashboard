          "ourReply": "The Dark Knight quote fits perfectly. But here's the twist — the playbook might actually be rational. OpenAI needs revenue diversity beyond API (ads), Anthropic needs regulatory moats (lobbying). The difference from old Big Tech: these companies hit $100B+ valuations in ~2 years, not 20. The incumbency cycle is compressing just like everything else AI touches.",

          "ourReply": "Exactly. And the nuance people miss: Karp didn't say AI replaces ALL software. He said it replaces the per-seat licensing model. The software still exists — it just gets consumed differently. Usage-based pricing, outcome-based contracts, AI-as-a-service. The $600B SaaS market doesn't vanish, it restructures. Winners adapt their pricing models. Losers cling to seat counts.",

          "ourReply": "The containment question might be the wrong frame entirely. It assumes superintelligence is a discrete thing you can put in a box. But it's more likely to emerge as a distributed capability across millions of specialized systems — no single entity to 'contain.' The real challenge isn't building walls, it's designing alignment that scales with capability. And we're running that experiment in real-time.",
