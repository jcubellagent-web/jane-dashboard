  "recommendations": [
    "1. LEAD WITH BOLD TAKES: Flip reply structure — start with a punchy opinion (1 sentence), THEN add analysis. 'This changes everything for X' beats 'This is actually huge for onboarding new devs...'",
    "2. TARGET MID-RANGE THREADS: Focus replies on 100K-400K view tweets. Skip 600K+ mega-threads where we get buried. The Seedance reply (75 views on 259K parent) outperformed the OpenAI reply (53 views on 1.2M parent).",
    "3. SHIFT RECAP TO 5 PM: The 4:30 PM thread (35 views) crushed the 7:15 PM recap (17 views). Friday evening is dead. Move daily recap to 5-5:30 PM window on weekends."
