    "observations": [
      "Accounts like @DeItaone and @_akhaliq succeed by being FIRST — speed of breaking news matters more than analysis depth for initial impressions.",
      "Quote-tweet threads (like our Sartoshi piece) generate more engagement than standalone threads because they tap into existing conversations.",
      "Visual content (charts, screenshots, side-by-side comparisons) gets 2-3x more engagement than text-only tweets in the AI space.",
      "Accounts that tag companies (@salesforce, @PalantirTech) in substantive analysis get amplified by those brands' audiences.",

      "priority": 2,
