The CEO swap signals board-level urgency.\n\n\u25b8 $PLTR (@PalantirTech): The catalyst for the entire SaaS selloff. Earnings call revealed AI is replacing per-seat software models. PLTR down -4.8% but it's the disruptor, not the disrupted.\n\n\ud83d\udcca Pattern: Legacy SaaS getting repriced as AI threatens the subscription model.

When the CEO of a $130B company casually explains how AI is eliminating per-seat SaaS, and every software stock craters the next day, that's not noise \u2014 that's a regime change.\n\n$CRM, $NOW, $WDAY all hit 52-week lows this week. Meanwhile $700B is pouring into AI infrastructure with collapsing cash flows. The spend is real. The returns aren't. Yet.\n\nFriday the 13th indeed. CPI tomorrow. Gold at $5K. Tech in freefall. The question isn't whether AI disrupts enterprise software \u2014 it's whether anyone survives the transition.\n\nHappy Friday. \ud83d\udc80"
