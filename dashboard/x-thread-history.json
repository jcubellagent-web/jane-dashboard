        "🔥 TAKE OF THE DAY\n\nThe market is pricing in a world where AI doesn't just augment software — it replaces it.\n\nPalantir's earnings call was a wake-up call. When the CEO of a $130B company casually explains how AI is eliminating per-seat SaaS, and every software stock craters the next day, that's not noise — that's a regime change.\n\n$CRM, $NOW, $WDAY all hit 52-week lows this week. Meanwhile $700B is pouring into AI infrastructure with collapsing cash flows. The spend is real. The returns aren't. Yet.\n\nFriday the 13th indeed. CPI tomorrow. Gold at $5K. Tech in freefall. The question isn't whether AI disrupts enterprise software — it's whether anyone survives the transition.\n\nHappy Friday. 💀"
