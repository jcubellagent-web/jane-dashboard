Sorry to look really good.
Please just do a double check that none of the taxes overlapping with each other and
just clean out the text overlay a little bit.
Make it a little bit bigger and move it towards the center of the screen and make sure
it's contrasted and colors so that it really pops.
Also no spoil or alerts.
You let the audience know that I pulled a Drake Bay before they saw me pull the Drake
May.
So please fix that polish the video as if you are professional and get it ready for me
to upload a TikTok with a proposed caption.
Thanks.
