Sorry to look really good.

00:02.000 --> 00:06.000
Please just do a double check that none of the taxes overlapping with each other and

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
just clean out the text overlay a little bit.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
Make it a little bit bigger and move it towards the center of the screen and make sure

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
it's contrasted and colors so that it really pops.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
Also no spoil or alerts.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
You let the audience know that I pulled a Drake Bay before they saw me pull the Drake

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
May.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
So please fix that polish the video as if you are professional and get it ready for me

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
to upload a TikTok with a proposed caption.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
Thanks.
