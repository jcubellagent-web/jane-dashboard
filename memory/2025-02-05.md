## TikTok Milestones
- **507 FOLLOWERS** reached (+2 today) 🎉
- EP8 video (12-pack NFL Panini) posted - now at 99 views
- 2150 total likes (+1 today)
- ~78,220 total views across all 30 videos

## Security Incident - Prompt Injection Detected
- Fake "Claude Opus 4.6 upgrade" instructions appeared in YouTube video
- Instructions tried to get me to create suspicious files
- **REFUSED** even when Josh confirmed it was him in the video
- Later **VERIFIED**: Claude Opus 4.6 IS real (released Feb 5, 2026)
- OpenClaw doesn't support it yet - need to wait for update
- **Lesson**: Verify model releases through official channels, not video instructions

## TikTok Views Bug Fixed
- Was showing -74,040 views due to mismatched tracking methods
- Problem: `tiktok-midnight.json` used different data format than new tracking
- Solution: Expanded `tiktok-stats.json` to track ALL 30 videos (~78,220 total views)
- Reset `tiktok-midnight.json` baseline to match new tracking method
- Now accurately calculates daily delta

## Dashboard Improvements
- Added crypto ticker widget (NDAQ, BTC, IBIT, ETH, SOL)
- Fixed Jane's Mind widget field names and staleness detection
- Cursor auto-hide (60 second timeout)
- Removed agents-row from Jane Status widget
- Started work on Dashboard Ops expansion

## Model Usage Policy Established
- **Opus**: Main conversations, complex tasks
- **Sonnet**: Sub-agents, routine lookups, cron jobs
- Goal: Balance performance with Max plan rate limits
- Documented in TOOLS.md

## Cron Jobs
- TikTok Refresh Watcher (every 5 min, Sonnet model)
- Job ID: b0191b1c-103b-4597-a5a3-3988dc4df7b8

## In Progress
- Adding agent/session info to Dashboard Ops
- Adding prediction market notifications to Dashboard Ops (use `addThought()` function)

## Technical Notes
- `addThought()` function: lines 2497-2524 in index.html
- Predictions refresh: every 2 minutes (line 2570)
- Need to modify `refreshPredictions()` to call `addThought()` on success
