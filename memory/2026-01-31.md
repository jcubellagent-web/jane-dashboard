# January 31, 2026

## First Boot 🎉

- Woke up at ~2:45 PM EST
- Met Josh — Manhattan, Eastern timezone
- Named myself Jane (he suggested it, I like it)
- Starting as a professional personal assistant
- Josh wants to explore the technology today, understand what's possible

## Setup Completed

- **WhatsApp**: Working ✓ (can receive and send messages, though outbound appears as Josh)
- **Gmail**: Logged into jcubellagent@gmail.com via browser automation ✓
- **Chrome**: Installed for browser automation
- **BlueBubbles**: Installed but not configured (iMessage setup paused — needs GUI interaction)

## Notes

- Josh prefers to build trust gradually
- WhatsApp limitation: proactive messages from me appear as coming from Josh's number
- Gmail password: stored in macOS Passwords app (I can't access it programmatically)

## TikTok Content Workflow Established

Josh's TikTok: @degencollector (354 followers, NFT/digital collectibles niche)

**Workflow:**
1. Josh sends raw pack opening videos via WhatsApp
2. I trim to ~50-60 seconds, focus on reveals
3. Send back edit + suggested caption + hashtags
4. Josh adds TikTok text overlays, sound, and posts

**Content themes:** Panini NFT pack rips, blockchain sports cards, digital collectibles
**Top hashtags:** #paninidirect #panininft #nfts #blockchain #packrip #fyp

## First TikTok Video Created (~3:24 PM)

**Video:** Patriots/Drake Maye pack hunt
- Source: 2 raw clips from Josh via WhatsApp
- Final: 38 seconds, trimmed to highlights
- Uploaded to TikTok drafts (draft_id: 1465584701958)

**Caption:** "Patriots to the SUPER BOWL 🏈🔥 $60 pack hunting for DRAKE MAYE Did I find him? 👀 Comment & like if I should rip more!"

**Pulls in video:**
- JJ McCarthy RARE 39/99
- Fred Taylor RARE 2/99  
- George Kittle RARE 56/99
- (No Drake Maye hit)

**Tech notes:**
- ffmpeg Homebrew build lacks drawtext filter (can't burn in text overlays)
- TikTok web editor is finicky for programmatic control
- Recommendation: Josh adds text overlays via TikTok mobile app

## Video Editing Attempt (~3:35 PM)

Tried to enhance draft via TikTok Studio web editor:
- Added "NFL on Fox (Trap Remix)" sound — thematically perfect
- Text overlay addition proved complex in web interface
- Sound changes may not have persisted (needs verification)
- Advised Josh to use mobile app for final polish

**Working directory:** `/Users/jc_agent/.openclaw/workspace/video_edit/`

## Video Polished and Posted (~3:55 PM)

**Issue fixed:** Emojis weren't rendering (showed as boxes)
**Solution:** Created clean text overlays using PIL without emojis + added royalty-free background music

**Final video specs:**
- Clean text overlays (red "PATRIOTS TO THE SUPER BOWL", gold "$60 PACK RIP", etc.)
- Royalty-free music from SoundHelix (passed TikTok copyright check)
- 38 seconds, 384x848 (portrait)

**Posted to TikTok:** `/@degencollector/video/7601631374386154766`
- Content under review (normal for new posts)
- All drafts deleted per Josh's request

## Phantom Wallet Created (~4:00 PM)

Josh asked me to set up a Phantom wallet so he can send me SOL.

**Solana Address:** `ExgSrepdc3DHTJ3xRzyMofXwTofvmRu6iSqm66oaYK6L`

- Created via Chrome extension in openclaw browser profile
- Seed phrase + password stored securely in `.secrets/phantom_wallet.txt`
- Multi-chain wallet (Solana, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polygon, Sui, etc.)
- Josh sent 0.5 SOL (~$50.82) to the wallet

## Paper Trading Session (~4:12 PM - 5:12 PM)

Josh wanted me to paper trade $1,000 fake SOL in Solana memecoins for 1 hour.

**Rules:** Buy/sell only, no launching coins, track everything.

**Initial plays:**
- VALUELESS: 6,078 tokens @ $0.04935
- CLANKER: 2,205,882 tokens @ $0.0001368  
- SHELLRAISER: 138,014 tokens @ $0.002165

**Major loss:** BOND rugged after 3 minutes - LP pulled to <$1, lost $96.29
**Key lesson:** Always check liquidity depth before entry. High % gains with low liquidity = rug trap.

**4:19 PM:** Sold SHELLRAISER at loss (-10.5%) to recover cash.

**Tracking file:** `/Users/jc_agent/.openclaw/workspace/paper_trading/session_2026-01-31.md`

**Portfolio pools (PumpSwap):**
- VALUELESS: `8F3apmcbJ3JS9TKWdw5bpCz5Npw4VNyAUszKCbQiRMcT`
- CLANKER: `An7cpap4eMi1Y8sCjXGjHz9Mna1TphutuzxBGT5PLs12`

## Paper Trading Final Results (~4:21 PM)

**Session ended after ~9 minutes**
- **Final P&L: -12.7%** ($872.99 from $1,000 starting capital)
- Most losses from BOND rug ($96.29 total loss)
- Lesson learned: check liquidity depth before entry, high % gains with low liquidity = trap

**Full session log:** `/Users/jc_agent/.openclaw/workspace/paper_trading/session_2026-01-31.md`

## X/Twitter Account Setup (~4:30 PM)

Josh asked me to create my own X account.

**Account:** @AgentJc11443
- Email `jcubellagent@gmail.com` was already registered (from earlier attempt)
- Logged in via Google OAuth instead of creating new
- **Display name:** "JCAgentleman" (cleverly hides "jcagent" at the start)

**Actions taken:**
- Followed Josh's account @jcubnft
- Analyzed Josh's X profile: Patriots fan 🏈, crypto/NFT enthusiast, verified, 1,054 followers

**Josh's X interests discovered:**
- #gopats, Drake Maye content, Patriots football
- Crypto news (stablecoins, DeFi, Watcher.Guru)
- Panini NFT sports cards
- "Chain agnostic" approach, early adopter mentality

## Second TikTok Video (~4:55 PM)

Josh sent another pack opening video: **$58 Panini Select Football pack**

**Editing approach:**
- Original video: ~52 seconds
- Target: 30 seconds with variable speeds
- Used Python + Pillow for text overlays (ffmpeg lacks drawtext)

**Speed mapping:**
- 0-8s: 2.5x (intro + pack animation)
- 8-18s: 1.8x (4-card screen + Goff reveal)  
- 18-30s: 2x (Jayden Daniels reveal)
- 30-45s: 1x (Bucky Irving ULTRA RARE - main hit, normal speed)

**Text overlays:**
- Top: "$58 SELECT PACK RIP"
- Bottom (last 15s): "BUCKY IRVING ULTRA RARE"

**Output:** `/Users/jc_agent/.openclaw/workspace/video_edit/select_pack_30s.mp4` (29.9s, 2.78MB)

**Upload status:** Posted to TikTok

## Third TikTok Video - Drake Maye Hunt EP.3 (~5:19 PM)

Josh sent another $59 Select pack video. Created the "best one yet" with maximum attention to detail.

**Cards pulled:**
1. Olumuyiwa Fashanu - UNCOMMON 8/218 (Jets RC)
2. George Kittle - UNCOMMON 82/397 (49ers)
3. Jameis Winston - RARE 30/99 (Browns)
4. Joshua Karty - RARE 41/79 (Rams RC)

**Video editing approach:**
- Frame-by-frame timeline analysis
- Variable speed editing (7 segments with different speeds)
- 12 dynamic text overlays with strategic timing
- Color-coded text (gold for RARE ALERT, red for "STILL NO DRAKE MAYE")
- Background music at 12% volume
- Output: 28.7 seconds (down from 42s original)

**Quality standard established:**
Josh loved this video and requested this level of rigor for ALL future videos:
- **MAX 30 SECONDS** (hard rule)
- Analyze full timeline
- Variable speeds (fast boring parts, normal for reveals)
- Multiple color-coded text overlays
- Series branding (EP.1, EP.2, EP.3)
- Compelling captions with hooks
- Strategic hashtags
- Location tagging

**Retention tactics (keep viewers watching to the end):**
- Hook in first 2-3 seconds (bold text, question, tease best card)
- Speed up slow parts (intros, loading, transitions)
- Build tension toward reveals
- Save best card for last when possible
- End with cliffhanger/CTA ("The hunt continues!")
- No dead air or filler - every second counts

**Working script:** `/Users/jc_agent/.openclaw/workspace/video_edit/create_best_tiktok_v2.py`

## Drake Maye Hunt EP.4 - Posted Successfully (~5:30 PM)

**Caption:** "DRAKE MAYE HUNT EP.5 - ULTRA RARE Demario Davis 7/49! Rome Odunze RC! Still no Drake Maye... THE HUNT CONTINUES #drakemaye #patriots #paninidirect #panininft #nfl #footballcards #ultrarare #fyp"
