## Dashboard v4.0 - Major Fixes Complete

### Fixed Today
- **"Online Today" timer** - Was showing page load time instead of time since midnight. Fixed `updateUptime()` to calculate `now - midnight` properly
- **Auto-initialization** - Simplified init flow, removed complex GridStack fallbacks that were failing. Now directly calls `initDataFetching()` on load
- **Edit Layout button** - Temporarily disabled (opacity 0.5, shows "coming soon" toast). GridStack drag-and-drop was causing init failures

### Technical Decisions
- Changed `let dataFetchingInitialized` to `var` to avoid TDZ errors
- Used `window.*` prefix for GridStack globals (`window.grid`, `window.DEFAULT_LAYOUT`, etc.)
- Added CSP with `'unsafe-eval'` for GridStack.js
- Weather has fallback: primary wttr.in, backup Open-Meteo

### Current State
- Dashboard served at `localhost:3000` (network: `192.168.5.21:3000`)
- Widgets working: Crypto prices, Weather (NYC), TikTok Growth, Work Intel, Mindmap
- Mac Mini Status shows actual system uptime from `/api/stats`
- Browser: Chrome profile `openclaw`
