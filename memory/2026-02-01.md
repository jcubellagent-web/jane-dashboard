## Major Dashboard Upgrades

### WebSocket Real-Time Push
- Added WebSocket server to dashboard for instant updates
- Server watches: `tasks.json`, `sessions.json`, `tiktok-stats.json`, `sorare-stats.json`
- Dashboard connects via WebSocket, receives push updates when files change
- "Live" indicator in header shows connection status
- Auto-reconnects if connection drops

### Night Mode
- Manual toggle button (🌙/☀️) in header next to Edit Layout
- Dims to 70% brightness, warm amber tint
- Preference saves to localStorage
- Originally was automatic 10pm-7am, changed to manual per Josh's request

### Auto-Start on Boot
- `com.jane.dashboard-server.plist` — Starts Node.js server
- `com.jane.dashboard.plist` — Opens Chrome in kiosk mode to dashboard
- Both in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`

### RAG Status Indicators
- Red/Amber/Green dots on in-progress tasks
- Green = on track, Amber = needs attention, Red = blocked
- Hover shows tooltip with status meaning

### Sub-Agents Widget
- Originally separate widget, merged into "Jane's Status" per Josh's request
- Shows cron jobs, spawned agents with status
- Updated via heartbeat to sessions.json

### Mobile Command Center
- Created `/mobile.html` — compact glanceable view
- Shows: tasks progress, RAG dots, positions, TikTok followers, SOL balance
- Josh actually prefers the main dashboard's mobile view (📱 toggle)

### Panini Widget Removed
- Removed per Josh's request
- Deleted from ALL_WIDGETS, WIDGET_INFO, refreshAll, initDataFetching

## App Icon Design Session

### Final Icon: Cosmic J-Bolt
- Lightning bolt shaped like a "J" (option 4 from combos)
- Background: subtle 3D network nodes + stars + small planets
- Colors: green (#4ade80) bolt on dark bg (#0a0f1a)
- Files: `icons/cosmic_v1.png` (512px), `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png`

### Icon Iterations
1. Basic shapes: robot arm, bolt, circuit, J letter
2. J + Lightning combos: 6 variations
3. Added circuit backgrounds
4. Changed to interconnected network nodes
5. Made 3D with depth-based opacity
6. Added stars and planets — Josh picked cosmic_v1

### Branding Update
- Changed logo from 🌿 leaf → 🦾 robot arm → cosmic icon image
- Replaced emoji with actual icon image in:
  - Header logo
  - Jane's Status card title
  - Chat panel header
  - Mobile command center
- Updated IDENTITY.md: "badass, capable, gets shit done"

## Communication Preferences (from earlier)
- **During long operations**: Narrate progress (don't go silent)
- **Heavy tasks**: Spawn sub-agents so main chat stays responsive
- Added to USER.md

## Memecoin Positions (end of day)
- WOJAK: +22% from entry
- COPPERINU: +22% from entry (took 50% profit earlier at +90%)
- pippin: -3% from entry
- All within strategy parameters, no trades triggered

## TikTok Stats
- @degencollector: 407 followers (+18 today), 2049 likes (+17 today)
- EP.8 and EP.9 posted today (now EP.9 showing as most recent with double EPIC)

### Comment Engagement (10:53 PM)
Checked notifications and replied to comments:
- ✅ **@avs.cards** on EP.4: "Do they still have nba licensed ones?" → Replied with NBA/NFL/WNBA/MLB info + link
- ✅ **@speedy.orange** on EP.4: Already replied yesterday about Panini Direct
- ✅ **@bucscards** on EP.5: Already replied about the app/website
- Most other notifications were new followers and video likes (lots of growth!)

## Mobile Optimizations (11:15 PM)

### 1. Pull-to-Refresh
- Swipe down from top of page to refresh all data
- Visual indicator shows progress ("Pull to refresh" → "Release to refresh" → "Refreshing...")
- Haptic feedback on completion (if device supports vibration)
- Disabled inside scrollable areas (chat, grid)

### 2. Floating Chat Button
- Already existed at bottom-right, verified always visible
- 56px on small mobile, 50px on larger phones
- Shows when chat panel is closed, hides when open

### 3. Larger Touch Targets (on mobile < 768px)
- Refresh buttons: 28px → 44px
- Close chat button: min 44px
- Night mode toggle: min 44px
- View toggle buttons: min 44px

### 4. Full-Screen Chat (on mobile < 480px)
- Chat panel now takes full screen on small phones
- Proper safe area insets for notch/home indicator
- Better padding for message input area
- Smooth open/close transitions

### Technical Notes
- Added `initPullToRefresh()` function with touch event handlers
- New CSS media query for < 480px full-screen chat
- Uses `env(safe-area-inset-*)` for notch-friendly padding
- Pull threshold: 80px before triggering refresh

## Desktop Optimizations (11:30 PM)

### Data Change Highlights
- Values flash green when increasing, red when decreasing
- Flash animation lasts 0.8s with glow effect
- Card/container also gets subtle background flash
- Applied to: TikTok followers/likes, SOL balance, trading P/L

### Smooth Number Animations
- Numbers count up/down smoothly instead of jumping
- 500ms duration with ease-out cubic timing
- Automatically formats with K/M suffixes for large numbers
- Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth 60fps animation

### More Pronounced Widget Borders
- `--border` opacity: 0.06 → 0.12
- `--border-hover` opacity: 0.12 → 0.22
- Added subtle outer glow: `0 0 0 1px rgba(255,255,255,0.03)`
- Cards now more visually distinct from background

### Technical Notes
- `animateNumber(element, newValue, duration)` - core animation function
- `flashElement(element)` - adds data-flash class
- `previousValues` object tracks TikTok, SOL, P/L for change detection
- CSS animations: `dataFlash`, `dataFlashUp`, `dataFlashDown`

## Technical Notes
- Dashboard backup: `dashboard_backup_20260201_214115/`
- Server runs on port 3000
- WebSocket on same port (upgrade from HTTP)
- File watchers use debounce (500ms) to avoid duplicate broadcasts

- `/dashboard/index.html` — Night mode, RAG indicators, sub-agents merge, icon branding
- `/dashboard/mobile.html` — New command center page
