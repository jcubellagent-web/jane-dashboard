## Late Night Dashboard Sprint (11:00 PM - 11:37 PM)

### Dashboard v9.0 → v10.3 Evolution
Heavy iteration session on mobile dashboard:

- **v9.0**: Fixed dead `mac-uptime` JS reference, merged Mac Mini + Jane widget
- **v9.1**: Connected accounts as horizontal scrollable row, sorted by usage
- **v9.2-9.4**: Prediction market filtering (no hockey, no non-Celtics basketball, Super Bowl always first)
- **v9.5**: Server returns 20 markets, frontend shows 15 after filtering
- **v9.6**: Added 24hr volume display per market
- **v9.7-9.8**: Pull-to-refresh with green glow + "✓ Release now!" indicator
- **v9.9**: Removed TikTok recent videos section
- **v10.0**: Created `tasks.json` for Completed Today widget; iOS PM scroll fix
- **v10.1**: M&A category with purple styling
- **v10.2**: Server prioritizes up to 3 M&A bets with >$100k volume
- **v10.3**: Source label (🟣 Polymarket / 🔷 Kalshi) per bet

### Kalshi API Discovery
- **Old endpoint** (deprecated): `trading-api.kalshi.com`
- **New endpoint**: `https://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/markets`
- Response structure: `{"cursor": "...", "markets": [...]}`
- Key fields: `ticker`, `title`, `yes_bid`, `yes_ask`, `last_price`, `volume_24h`, `status`
- Prices in cents (`response_price_units: "usd_cent"`)
- Integration in progress for server.js

### Technical Decisions
- **M&A detection keywords**: acquire, acquisition, merger, merge, buyout, takeover, "will buy", "deal to buy"
- **Pull-to-refresh thresholds**: Show at 20px, ready at 70px (lowered for iOS)
- **Market balancing**: M&A first (up to 3), finance (4 min), sports (up to 3), fill remaining

## Pending
- [ ] Dashboard v2.0 build (sub-agent working on it)
- [ ] PENGUIN alerts active (every 30 min)
- [ ] TikTok check schedule: 2-3x daily if 4+ hours since last check
