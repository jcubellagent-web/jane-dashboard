# 2026-02-04 Daily Notes

## Dashboard Work (Continued from Feb 3)

### v10.8-10.9 Updates
- Replaced all 🦾 robot arm emojis with Jane logo (`icon-192.png`)
  - Page title, widget headers, chat overlay, agent list
  - CSS classes: `.jane-logo-icon` (24px), `.jane-logo-chat` (28px), `.jane-logo-small` (20px)
- Added right-side padding (1.75rem) for right-thumb scrolling comfort

### Second Brain Widget Redesign (In Progress)
- Josh requested cooler visualization for "What I Know" widget
- Current: bubble-map with positioned divs (Work, Sports, Crypto categories)
- Goal: Neural network / knowledge graph style visualization
- Shows what the AI "knows" about the user as it learns
- Must be visually digestible but impressive

### AI News Widget Added
- Enterprise vs Retail categorization tabs
- Google News RSS via CORS proxy
- Auto-categorizes based on keywords
- Placed below Prediction Markets widget

### CoinStats Integration (Blocked)
- API key saved: `.secrets/coinstats_api_key.txt`
- Share token obtained: `rmyp1v3GQ4cJOkI`
- **Blocked**: Requires Degen Plan ($14/mo) for portfolio API access
- Josh opted to pass on subscription for now

### Technical Notes
- tasks.json field must be `inProgress` not `active` (matches dashboard JS)
- Kalshi API endpoint: `https://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/markets`
- Dashboard file: `/dashboard/mobile.html` (currently v10.9)

## Overnight Architecture Audit (~12:30 AM)

Josh requested full architecture review and optimization before bed.

### Improvements Implemented:

**1. Network Resilience**
- Added `fetchWithRetry()` utility - 2 retries with exponential backoff
- Request timeouts (5-12 seconds depending on endpoint)
- Offline detection with visual banner
- Data caching for offline fallback

**2. External API Failsafes**
- Solana RPC: Fallback from publicnode.com to mainnet-beta
- AI News: Dual proxy support (allorigins.win + corsproxy.io)
- DexScreener: Added timeout protection

**3. WebSocket Improvements**
- Exponential backoff reconnection (3s → 6s → 12s → ... max 60s)
- Duplicate connection prevention
- Better error handling and logging

**4. Code Cleanup**
- Removed duplicate `fetchJaneStatus` interval calls
- Consolidated refresh intervals with comments
- Added XSS protection via `escapeHtml()` helper

**5. Error Handling**
- `showWidgetError()` helper for user-friendly error states
- Graceful degradation when APIs fail
- Console logging for debugging
