# 2026-02-07 - Evening Session

## X/Twitter Growth Launch
- Posted first 5 engagement replies via sub-agent to @0xDeployer, @petergyang, @polyphonicchat, @minchoi, @Rahll
- All replies were AI/crypto themed, quality engagement on high-visibility threads
- @minchoi reply got 45 views (thread had 82K views) — riding popular threads works
- Analytics: 50 impressions, 12% engagement rate, 6 engagements, 6 followers, 10 following
- X API is too expensive ($100+/mo) — using browser scraping via heartbeats every 2-3 hours instead
- Added X stats refresh to HEARTBEAT.md with on-demand flag file (.x-refresh-requested)
- Manual refresh button now writes flag file for next heartbeat to pick up

## X Growth Widget Updates
- Fixed "undefined" in recent activity — replies used `content` field, widget read `text`
- Replies now show "Replied to @handle" format
- Added neon SVG icons (heart/chat/eye) with glow for engagement stats
- Numbers brightened to #e2e8f0 with more spacing
- Harvey balls for action plan — daily tasks with pie-wedge SVG fill indicators
- Action plan changed to "Action Plan for Today" — resets at midnight via server date check
- x-plan.json stores daily tasks, served via /api/x-plan, WebSocket-connected

## Mind Widget Bug Fix (Critical)
- **Root cause**: `updateMind()` preserved old task/steps when receiving null/empty
- `if (task)` skipped null updates, `if (steps.length > 0)` skipped empty arrays
- Fixed: always update mindState.task and mindState.steps regardless of value
- Added else branch to clear steps container when steps array is empty
- Sub-agents writing to mind-state.json after main session wrote idle caused stale display

## Local Models
- Confirmed MLX Stable Diffusion 2.1 already installed at `/tmp/mlx-examples/stable_diffusion/`
- Generated test image successfully (~14s, ~1.5GB RAM)
- Installed Mistral 7B via `ollama pull mistral` (4.4GB, Q4_K_M quantization)
- Tested: responds correctly ("Hello, there friend!")
- Updated mind widget: detection for 'mistral', tooltip, region mappings
- Renamed MFLUX to "Stable Diffusion" in color key (Josh's request)
- Changed Ollama color from amber (245,158,11) to distinct orange (249,115,22) to differentiate from Whisper yellow

## RAM Optimization
- Audit: 16GB total, 8GB used, Ollama had 5GB loaded (Mistral + nomic-embed-text simultaneously)
- Set OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=2m (was 5m default) — models unload faster
- Set OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS=1 — prevents multiple large models parked in RAM
- Restarted Ollama — freed ~5GB immediately
- 27 Chrome renderer processes consuming significant memory

## Dashboard Server Updates
- Added /api/x-plan endpoint with midnight auto-reset
- Added /api/x-refresh POST endpoint (writes .x-refresh-requested flag)
- Added x-plan.json to WATCHED_FILES for WebSocket updates
- Server restarted multiple times for new endpoints

## Ollama Models Inventory
- nomic-embed-text (274MB) — embeddings, configured as OpenClaw memorySearch
- llama3.1:8b (4.9GB) — local LLM
- mistral:latest (4.4GB) — NEW, general-purpose local LLM
