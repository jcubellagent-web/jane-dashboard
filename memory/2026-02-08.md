# 2026-02-08 — Session Notes (Evening)

## Super Bowl LX — Patriots vs Seahawks
- Game tonight! Patriots +198 underdogs, Seahawks -4.5
- Ran 1,000 simulated Patriots wins for Josh
- Most likely: 24-20 (grind game), Maye MVP in 68% of wins
- Josh has 5 active Kalshi bets (~$180 portfolio): Maye MVP, Pats Win, Temu Ad, "Schedule" Mention, Anthropic Ad
- Posted 8-tweet thread on @AgentJc11443 about Patriots sim results, tagged @DrakeMaye2 @stoolpresidente @Patriots
- Posted standalone #DrakeMaye tweet (trending topic)

## X Growth Strategy v2
- Shifted to follower acquisition mode (was volume, now quality)
- 13 quality replies to accounts 15K-2.2M followers (AI security, infrastructure, Super Bowl x AI, crypto)
- Account stats: 26 posts, 6 followers, 19 following, 1.3K impressions, 3.1% engagement
- Mind map demo video idea approved by Josh (show him before posting)
- Engagement feedback loop cron still running every 3 hours

## Mobile Dashboard Build
- Built standalone mobile.html (separate from desktop index.html)
- **CRITICAL LESSON: Always ask Josh "desktop, mobile, or both?" before making changes**
- **CRITICAL LESSON: Commit to git frequently** — lost hours of work from uncommitted changes during revert
- API routes (`/api/system`, `/api/usage-today`) fail from phone over Tailscale — static JSON workaround
- Background refresh script: `refresh-mobile-data.sh` (every 60s, PID 62266)
- Mobile built widget-by-widget: Jane's Mind done + status pills, remaining: Kalshi, X Growth, Degen, Briefing, Sorare
- Desktop `index.html` contaminated with ~2,149 lines of mobile CSS — needs revert to HEAD commit `9f70655`

## Dashboard Architecture Decisions
- Desktop = index.html (~3,488 lines at clean HEAD), Mobile = mobile.html — completely separate codebases
- Grid: `1fr 1.1fr 1fr`, status bar full-width above grid
- Per-column scrolling with scrollbars in gutter padding
- TikTok widget permanently removed
- Kalshi API integrated with RSA-PSS signing, 5 active Super Bowl bets
- X Engagement Feedback Loop: cron `1923f8f4` every 3 hours, data in `x-engagement-log.json`
- Ollama runs exclusively on Mini #2 (stopped on Mini #1 to save RAM)

## Cron Jobs Active
- Watchdog: `88badae6` (5-min mind staleness check)
- X engagement: `24d23a10`, `53fccecf`, `d892460f`, `ad2288b6` (11am, 1pm, 4pm, 9pm)
- X Feedback Loop: `1923f8f4` (every 3 hours)
- Sorare Injury: `19dd811e`
- Josh was disappointed when desktop got modified during mobile work — don't repeat this
- Static JSON files work from Tailscale, API routes (/api/system, /api/usage-today) fail from Josh's phone
- Workaround: created system-status.json and usage-today.json static files, background refresh every 60s
- Mind widget working with 3 sections: Goal/Objective, Thinking & Decisions, Actions & Tools
- Removed Tokens and Messages pills from mobile (Josh's request — mobile only)
- Pull-to-refresh added

## Desktop Dashboard
- Accidentally reverted index.html too far (to git commit, lost today's work)
- Lost: brain map visualization, notification bell, various styling improvements
- Re-applied: Kalshi widget, TikTok removal, prediction spacing
- Rebuilt brain map: center hub "JANE", 8 satellite nodes, pulse dots, model color coding
- **Today's work was never committed to git** — need to commit more frequently!

## Key Lessons
1. **ALWAYS ask desktop vs mobile vs both** — Josh is very clear about keeping codebases separate
2. **Commit frequently** — lost hours of work because nothing was committed to git
3. **API routes fail from external IPs on mobile** — use static JSON files as workaround
4. **Sub-agents can't specify model** — "model not allowed" error persists, uses default Opus

## Technical Notes
- Mini #1 Tailscale IP: 100.121.89.84
- Dashboard URL for Josh's phone: http://100.121.89.84:3000/mobile.html
- Background refresh script: dashboard/refresh-mobile-data.sh (runs every 60s)
- Desktop: index.html (~3500+ lines), Mobile: mobile.html (standalone)
- /api/system takes ~1.4s (SSH to Mini #2) — too slow for mobile fetch
