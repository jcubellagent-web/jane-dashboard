# 2026-02-09 — Evening Session

## Mobile Dashboard Improvements
- **Galaxy background** replaced neural sphere on mind map, then switched to all-green futuristic sci-fi theme (data particles, grid, scan line, streaks) per Josh's feedback
- **Pull-to-refresh** redesigned: spinning Jane logo icon (icon-192.png) instead of loading bar
- **Jane logo** replaced brain emoji in mind widget title and PTR
- **Loading bar fade-out** fixed: was snapping back (300ms timeout vs 1.2s fade). Now waits for fade to complete before resetting
- **Ticker strip** added: BTC, ETH, SOL, NDAQ + 2 placeholder slots. Shows % change only (no prices), with red/green market status dots. API key is `nasdaq` not `ndaq`
- **X/Twitter growth strip** added: profile pic (x-pfp.jpg), engagement rate as hero metric, followers, views, likes with 24h growth deltas, planned replies (blue dot) and planned tweets (green dot)
- **Model color-coding** extended to goal text and individual step labels (each step colored by its tool/model field)
- **Mind map lines** recalculated: now edge-to-edge (hub radius 9 offset, node radius 2.5 offset)
- **Mind-state behavioral fix**: Always write specific descriptive `task` values, never generic "Working...". Show "Sending WhatsApp response" → "sent" step before going idle.

## X/Twitter Major Pivot
- **Crypto-security niche ABANDONED** — Josh explicitly doesn't want public discussion of this
- **2 crypto-security replies deleted** by sub-agent (sodofi and peter_szilagyi replies)
- **New niche: AI news feed bot** — daily AI innovations, macro moves, M&A deals
- **Bio updated** to: "AI-powered news bot | Daily AI innovations, macro moves & M&A deals | Your optimized data feed | Built by @jcubnft"
- **Rebrand announcement posted**: https://x.com/AgentJc11443/status/2021071137480782225
- **Thread template locked in** (`x-thread-template.md`):
  - Tweet 1: Anchor with date
  - Tweet 2: 🤖 Foundational Model Providers (7 core + 2-3 wildcards)
  - Tweet 3: 💼 AI Business & M&A
  - Tweet 4: 📊 Markets snapshot
  - Tweet 5: 🔥 Take of the Day
- **Core providers tracked**: Anthropic (🟢), OpenAI (🔵), Google DeepMind (🔴), Meta AI (🟣), Mistral (⚪), xAI (⚫), DeepSeek (🔷)
- **Wildcard slots**: rotate daily for Cohere, Stability, Perplexity, HuggingFace, etc.
- **Content plan file**: `dashboard/x-content-plan.json` with rolling 24h tracking
- **x-strategy.md needs updating** to reflect new direction

## Key Files Changed
- `dashboard/mobile.html` — extensive updates (galaxy bg, ticker, X strip, PTR, logos, color-coding)
- `dashboard/x-pfp.jpg` — downloaded real @AgentJc11443 profile pic
- `dashboard/x-content-plan.json` — rolling 24h content plan
- `x-thread-template.md` — daily AI brief thread format
- Multiple git commits throughout session

## Critical Reminders
- **NEVER discuss crypto-security publicly on X** — Josh is very clear about this
- **Mind-state must always have descriptive task** — not "Working..."
- **Show "Sending WhatsApp response" step** before going idle
- **Update mind-state at start of every voice note** with "Transcribing voice note from Josh" (whisper model)
- **Browser conflicts**: sub-agents and main session can't use browser simultaneously — plan accordingly
