## X/Twitter Rebrand to AI News Feed Bot
- Josh gave voice instructions to fully rebrand @AgentJc11443 as a public AI news feed bot
- **X bio updated**: removed @jcubnft personal handle, now says "Refined by my owner, powered by Claude"
- **Thread template finalized** (6 tweets): Anchor+Storm Check → Model Providers → M&A (High Probability + Rumor Mill) → NASDAQ 100 Movers → Crypto Movers → Hot Take
- Rumor Mill section has ⚠️ disclaimer + (🤖 hypothetical) tags for made-up deals
- Headlines/takes moved to TOP of NASDAQ and Crypto mover sections (Josh's preference)
- **First AI Daily Brief thread posted**: https://x.com/AgentJc11443/status/2021079941530407325

## Aggressive Engagement Strategy
- Josh wants "crazy mode": 5-6 replies every 2 hours to popular influencer/news threads
- 24h plan: 4 daily brief threads + 48 replies = ~52 total posts/day
- Running hours: 8am-midnight ET (8 cycles)
- Clean slate: delete ALL old tweets except daily brief thread (sub-agent working on it, first attempt failed — second spawned)
- Followed ~40 key accounts (AI news, tech, markets, crypto, influencers) before getting rate limited
- Account now at 34 following, 8 followers

## Mobile Dashboard Updates
- **Tweet feed widget added**: shows latest tweets from @AgentJc11443 with thread numbers, engagement stats
- Reads from `x-latest-tweets.json`, refreshes every 2 min
- Josh explicitly said NASDAQ 100 movers widget was NOT for mobile dashboard — only for X thread template
- **Reverted mobile.html** twice after accidentally adding market movers widget

## X Banner
- Josh wants: black background, neon green Jane J logo, "daily" in small green text to the right
- Created with futuristic digital elements (circuit traces, hexagons, data particles, grid)
- Saved as `dashboard/x-banner.png` (1500x500)
- Sent to Josh for approval, awaiting response

## Key Lessons
- **LISTEN CAREFULLY to voice notes** — Josh said "Twitter daily updates template" not "mobile dashboard"
- Don't assume where content goes — always confirm mobile vs X vs desktop
- Sub-agents for tweet deletion need very explicit instructions (first one failed silently)
- X rate limits following at fast bursts — use small batches (5-10) with pauses
- `sonnet` model override still not allowed for sub-agents — falls back to opus

## Template File
- `x-thread-template.md` — canonical 6-tweet thread format
- `dashboard/x-content-plan.json` — rolling 24h content plan
- `dashboard/x-latest-tweets.json` — feed data for mobile widget
- `dashboard/market-movers.json` — NASDAQ 100 scraper data (for X threads, NOT mobile)
- `dashboard/refresh-market-movers.sh` — slickcharts scraper script
