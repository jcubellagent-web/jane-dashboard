# 2026-02-10 — Evening Session

## Context Overflow & Cleanup
- Hit context overflow from heavy session (PWA work, screenshots, voice messages)
- Slimmed MEMORY.md (75% smaller) and TOOLS.md (57% smaller)
- Archived implementation details to `memory/reference.md`
- Added context overflow prevention to HEARTBEAT.md

## PWA App (Mobile Dashboard)
- Built PWA with manifest, service worker, meta tags on mobile.html
- **HTTPS required** for Service Workers — set up self-signed cert on port 3443
- Josh installed cert profile on iPhone + enabled full trust in Certificate Trust Settings
- **Icon fix**: iOS ignores manifest icons over IP-based HTTPS — fixed by embedding base64 apple-touch-icon directly in HTML
- PWA install link: `https://100.121.89.84:3443/mobile.html`
- Cert file: `.secrets/tls/selfsigned.crt` and `.secrets/tls/selfsigned.key`

## Push Notifications — WORKING ✅
- VAPID keys: `.secrets/vapid-keys.json` (original, not the underscore one)
- Subscriptions: `dashboard/push-subscriptions.json`
- Send via: `curl -sk -X POST https://100.121.89.84:3443/api/push/send -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title":"Jane 🦾","body":"message here"}'`
- Server endpoints: `/api/push/vapid-key`, `/api/push/subscribe`, `/api/push/send`

## Dashboard Optimizations
- Mobile: CSS containment, cached DOM refs, canvas pauses when hidden, smart intervals, WebSocket exponential backoff
- Transcript poll reduced 200ms → 100ms for faster mind activation
- Desktop WS reconnect reduced 3s → 1s
- Fixed header/status bar gap on mobile (solid #0a0a0f backgrounds)

## Config Changes
- Response prefix changed from `[openclaw]` to 🦞 emoji (`messages.responsePrefix`)
- Closed all stale Chrome tabs/processes — cron jobs need cleanup fix

## X Stats
- Per-tweet views showing 0 in x-latest-tweets.json — scraper needs fix
- Overall stats working: 6.1K impressions, 3.7% engagement, 15 followers

## TODO
- Fix cron jobs to close browser tabs after use (Chrome tab buildup)
- Fix per-tweet view count scraping
- Monitor context usage — suggest /new proactively when >60%
