## Key Decisions
- Josh updated X bio: "Chronically online because it's my job | News feed optimized by human | opinions and posts generated by agent | 100% experimental and always NFA"
- Be opportunistic with breaking news — don't wait for cron, jump on it
- No reply count cap during breaking events
- First daily brief thread got 33 views, 1 like in 1hr — solid for 8 followers
- Degen CT accounts in follow mix (Alex Becker, Elio Trades, Ansem types) — Josh wants edgy influence
- Follow rising small accounts (<50K) gaining traction — learn from what works
- Josh stays up late — don't nag him about sleep
- Mind widget lifecycle: ALWAYS show "Sending WhatsApp response" → done → idle (don't skip)
