# 2026-02-11 — Tuesday

## Dashboard Improvements (Morning Session)
- **Merged X widgets**: Combined X stats strip + tweet feed into one unified card. Stats pinned at top, threads swipeable below.
- **Today's Jobs widget fix**: Was reading `cron-schedule.json` (groups format) not `cron-jobs.json`. Multi-time entries like "8 AM, 10 AM" broke the time regex — split into individual rows.
- **Recurring jobs**: Don't cross off recurring jobs — show "next ~TIME" instead. Only mark overnight-only jobs as done.
- **Removed misleading timestamp** from X widget top-right.
- **24h growth deltas**: Added `prev24h` field to x-stats.json — JS already supported it, just needed data. Shows +8 flw, +3.1K views, +14 likes in green.
- **Content plan**: Widget reads `x-content-plan.json` — was stuck on yesterday's data. Must update daily.
- **Thread history**: `x-thread-history.json` is the primary data source for tweet feed (not x-latest-tweets.json). Must add full tweet text, not summaries.
- **Connected accounts**: Moved @DeItaone and @_akhaliq from My Accounts to Data Sources in server.js. Server restart required for changes to take effect.
- **Sub-agent satellites**: Mind map already had `subAgents` array support — just needed to populate it in mind-state.json with `{label, status}` objects.

## X Account Growth
- Hit **24 followers** (up from 19 yesterday, 8 two days ago)
- 9.3K impressions, 3.3% engagement rate, 100 posts
- **Key insight confirmed**: Mid-size threads (10K-75K views, <100 replies) = sweet spot. Mega-threads = death (buried).
- **Emollick replies CAN work** — SeeDance video topic got 318 views
- Opinionated thesis format >> data corrections
- X filtering hit 3/5 morning replies — may need to space further apart

## Enterprise SaaS Section
- Josh wants **Enterprise SaaS × AI** section added to daily briefs starting tomorrow
- Draft saved to `dashboard/enterprise-saas-draft.md`
- Key narrative: "SaaSpocalypse" — OpenAI Frontier, Anthropic Claude Cowork disrupting Salesforce/Workday/Intuit
- Need to follow all major SaaS accounts (Workday, ServiceNow, Salesforce, etc.)

## Sorare
- **Free packs**: Now under Play > Set tab > "Free claim" button (not old /nba/free-cards URL). ~24h timer.
- **GW33 completed**: Team 1 rank 3858/8587 (eligible for reward). Cleared from widget.
- **Crafting status**: 462/1000 Essence needed. ~2-4 weeks to first craft. Closest collections: Celtics 2/10, Warriors 2/11.
- **Updated Sorare cron**: Expanded checklist (6 tasks), bumped timeout 600s→900s, auto-updates dashboard files.
- **Cleaned task list**: Removed non-daily items (weekly missions, collection bonuses, hot streaks, card sealing) — only show actionable daily tasks.

## Cron Job Sync Issue
- Cron jobs don't auto-update `cron-schedule.json` or `x-content-plan.json` after completing. Need to add dashboard sync instructions to all cron payloads. TODO for next quiet period.

## X Password
- Josh tried logging in to X from phone. Gmail password (`Sebcup-cocqon-1fuhry`) didn't work. Suggested `JCAgent123!!!`. Need to verify/reset if neither works.
- When sending passwords, send ONLY the password text (no emoji prefix) so it's easy to copy-paste.

## Strategic Follows
- Spawned sub-agents for: strategic AI/markets follows, enterprise SaaS company follows
- Priority info sources: @DeItaone, @_akhaliq, @ylecun, @DarioAmodei, @sama, etc.
- Priority growth targets: @emollick, @StockSavvyShay, @SahilBloom, @slow_developer
- Enterprise SaaS: @Workday, @ServiceNow, @Salesforce, @SAP, @Palantir, @Datadog, etc.

## Coinbase Password
- Stored at `.secrets/coinbase_password.txt`
- Saved 6:17 PM EST

## Evening Session (6:17 PM - 7:18 PM EST)

### Coinbase Agentic Wallet — COMPLETE ✅
- Josh created Coinbase account with password `tX939jSn9ipkN4$A` (saved to `.secrets/coinbase_password.txt`)
- Coinbase rejected Twilio number for verification — requires real mobile number
- Josh logged in and I completed setup from the portal
- **CDP API Key**: `d84fd6b3-93a3-4001-81c4-876eae8f587a` (saved to `.secrets/coinbase_cdp_api_key.txt`)
- **Wallet Secret**: Generated from portal at `/products/server-wallet/accounts` (saved to `.secrets/coinbase_wallet_secret.txt`)
- **Project ID**: `7e1fcc61-d1d8-44d1-b28d-cadc353e200b`
- **EVM (Base) Address**: `0xe8f6f50c79d24ef271764447E46f66f1Ef4Cae8F`
- **Solana Address**: `8nqcu8QUff1sSQabnzTLUzSPS4byvoPs9m9oUrGvFJUa`
- Used `@coinbase/cdp-sdk` npm package (installed at `/tmp/cdp-test/`)
- Josh sent 2 SOL (~$158.54) to the Solana wallet!
- Wallet data file: `dashboard/coinbase-wallet.json`

### Desktop Dashboard Redesign Marathon
Josh iterated heavily on desktop (index.html). Changes made via sub-agents + direct edits:
1. Brain SVG enlarged (260→420→480→580px), shifted right for more text space
2. X widget expanded (380→520→600→50% of screen via 1fr 1fr grid)
3. Sorare widget hidden on desktop
4. X widget: swipeable cards → scrollable list with pinned morning brief
5. Emojis replaced with neon SVG icons (green glow, amber for fire/pin)
6. Brain labels glow tool colors (green=Opus, yellow=Whisper, orange=Ollama)
7. Sub-agent display: orbiting dots removed → dotted box top-right with 🤖 icons
8. Brain idle animation: scan rings restored (dimmed), pulse waves, hex grid, floating labels
9. Coinbase wallet widget: sleek card with Coinbase blue, $158.54 balance
10. X stats: daily growth since midnight tracking with baseline file
11. Threads/Replies tabs added then removed (Josh didn't like replies tab look)

### Key Lessons
- Sub-agents editing same file causes conflicts — duplicate JS fragments caused dashboard crash
- Mind-widget-watchdog cron overwrites mind-state.json with auto-detected state — need to clear completed sub-agents promptly
- `x-thread-history.json` must be updated by ALL cron jobs that post threads — was missing 4:30PM and 6PM updates
- Tweet time rendering: use `tweet.timestamp` (ISO format), not `tweet.time` (raw "6:00 PM" string) — causes Invalid Date
- Coinbase CDP wallet setup flow: API key (portal) → wallet secret (Server Wallet > Accounts > Generate) → SDK createAccount
- `npx awal` CLI times out on Mac Mini — use SDK directly instead

### Coinbase Reply Sub-Agent
- Spawned `coinbase-wallet-replies` to reply to @CoinbaseDev and Brian Armstrong
- Sub-agent struggled with browser issues, tried restarting gateway — unclear if it completed
- May need to post manually


## Memecoin Trading Mandate (7:41 PM)
- Josh gave full autonomy to trade with 1.5 SOL from Coinbase wallet
- Strategy: memecoin swing trades
- Min market cap: $150K (hard floor)
- Extra rug-check DD required for anything under $300K mcap
- Full autonomy on TP/SL, token selection, sources
- Track all trades in desktop dashboard widget with P&L, TP/SL targets
- Spawned sub-agent to build trading widget + token scanner
