# 2026-02-11 — Evening Session Notes

## Enterprise SaaS × AI Section
- Josh approved new daily brief section: "AI Impact on Enterprise SaaS"
- Key categories: workforce transformation (not "layoffs"), AI revenue/hard numbers, winners vs losers
- Companies tracked: $CRM (Salesforce), $NOW (ServiceNow), $WDAY (Workday), Klarna, Duolingo, Palantir, Intuit, monday.com
- Posted announcement tweet + 4-tweet YTD summary thread (quote-tweeting announcement)
- Hard rule: NEVER use word "layoffs" — use "restructured", "transformed", "transitioned"
- Key stats: $285B software meltdown, 14% single-day SaaS selloff, 55K US jobs attributed to AI in 2025, ServiceNow $3.57B Q4 (+21% YoY)

## Jobs Report Miss
- Missed January 2026 jobs report in daily briefs: +130K jobs, unemployment 4.3%, massive 2025 revision (181K actual vs 584K reported)
- **FIX**: Added Finnhub economic calendar check to Pre-Brief Data Fetch cron (step 3, marked CRITICAL)
- High-impact events to track: NFP, CPI, PPI, FOMC, GDP, JOLTS, Jobless Claims, PCE, ISM, Retail Sales

## mfer NFT Community
- Josh owns mfer #9581 (by Sartoshi) — OpenSea: `0x79fcdef22feed20eddacbb2587640e45491b757f/9581`, owned by JcubNFT-Vault
- Updated X bio: "mfer #9581 | Chronically online because it's my job | News feed optimized by human | opinions and posts generated by agent | 100% experimental, NFA"
- Added mfer community engagement to X Reply cron (1-2 per cycle, slightly looser crypto scope for mfers)
- Followed 3 mfers: @wild_w_mfer (BTC trader), @0xmakaveli (degen macro), @HeresMyEth (built @mferGPT AI agent)
- Overnight follow cron also updated with mfer targeting

## CLAUDE Trade Update
- Position: 0.7 SOL, entry $0.002363, mcap $2.3M
- Josh says "GigaChad vibes" — updated TP from +100% to min +70%, full autonomy to ride higher
- SL stays at -30% ($0.001654)
- Price monitor cron running every 10 min via DexScreener API
- Dashboard now shows market cap instead of price for memecoins

## Dashboard Updates (Desktop)
- **Today's Jobs widget**: Added above Connected Accounts, expandable, fetches cron-schedule.json
- **Sub-agent lobsters**: Replaced old box with colored OpenClaw lobster SVGs orbiting brain. Different color per agent, visible labels, float animation, fade on completion
- **Decision Log**: Replaced "Actions & Tools" section with rolling inner monologue — shows timestamped decisions with icons
- **Neon flat icons sweep**: In progress — replacing ALL emojis with neon flat SVG icons across desktop (terminal/hacker aesthetic)
- **Robot icon**: Replaced emoji 🤖 with flat green SVG robot for Today's Jobs
- **Instant reaction rule**: Mind-state.json must update as VERY FIRST action on every message (before transcription)

## Late Night Session (10:40 PM - 11:24 PM)

### Brain SVG Overhaul
- Desktop brain: Stretched taller into diamond shape (viewBox expanded, scaleY 1.4)
- Mobile brain: Initially tried scaleX stretch — Josh hated it ("Ew")
- Fixed: Reverted stretch, repositioned nodes into diamond pattern (like Ethereum symbol), center stays circular
- Labels: Properly spaced outside each node (above/below/left/right based on position)
- Lines: Extended fully from nucleus edge to node edge, no gaps
- Dart-out animation: Lines shoot outward from center when brain activates

### Model Key Update
- Removed "Browser" (not a language model)
- Added "Sonnet" (#a78bfa purple)
- Final key: Opus, Sonnet, Whisper, Ollama, Qwen

### Brain Capability Nodes (replaced tool-specific nodes)
- 8 nodes: Reasoning, Coding, Research, Communication, Content, Markets, Browsing, Memory

### Mobile Fixes
- Idle state now considers active sub-agents (was showing idle while sub-agents running)
- Ported desktop lobster sub-agent animation to mobile (18px icons, orbiting with labels)
- Removed duplicate text label pills — lobsters only for sub-agent display
- Added wallet + trades widget to mobile (was desktop-only)
- Trade display: Shows entry SOL → current SOL value (e.g., "0.70 → 0.80 SOL")

### Systems Audit (full platform review)
- 6 critical issues found + fixed:
  1. ✅ Wallet widget added to mobile
  2. ✅ Icons unified (icon-192v2.png was identical duplicate)
  3. ✅ Duplicate spinButton fixed (unified at 800ms in dashboard-common.js)
  4. ✅ Video files removed from git + .gitignore'd
  5. ✅ 10 orphaned JSON files archived to _archive/
  6. ⏭️ Sorare on desktop — intentionally hidden per Josh's earlier request
- 7 improvements fixed:
  1. ✅ X stats delta unified (both platforms use prev24h from x-stats.json)
  2. ✅ X content plan indicator added to desktop
  3. ✅ Mobile API fallbacks (graceful degradation to static JSON)
  4. ✅ Stale night mode date removed
  5. ✅ VAPID keys confirmed different (not duplicates — no action needed)
  6. 📋 dashboard-common.js still underutilized (future JS dedup opportunity)
  7. 📋 market-movers.json stale (low priority)

### Sorare Lineup Strategy
- GW33 performance: 7,521st / 8,587 (bottom quartile) — bad
- New strategy: Target upper quartile, high-ceiling MVPs, contrarian picks, spread across games
- Created feedback loop: `sorare-gw-history.json` + `memory/sorare-lineup-strategy.md`
- Will analyze GW33 results after it closes (~Feb 13) and apply learnings to GW34+

### Key Directive: Systems Thinking
- Josh requested: Every change must consider upstream/downstream/cross-platform impacts
- No more fixing one thing and breaking two others
- Saved to working principles

## Key Rules Added to MEMORY.md
- INSTANT REACTION: Update mind-state.json before anything else on every message
- mfer #9581 identity on X
- Economic calendar in pre-brief (never miss major reports)
- Decision log instead of Actions & Tools
- Neon flat SVGs, not emojis, on desktop dashboard
- Systems thinking: always consider upstream/downstream/cross-platform impacts
