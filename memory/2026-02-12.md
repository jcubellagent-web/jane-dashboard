# 2026-02-12 — Morning Session Notes

## Dashboard Fixes
- **Brain SVG**: Removed `scaleY(1.4)` stretch, reshaped nodes into diamond pattern (Ethereum logo style). Nodes at dy: ±130 (top/bottom), ±70 (upper/lower), 0 (mid). ViewBox adjusted to `-10 20 220 380`.
- **X tweet timestamps**: Fixed ISO timestamps (`2026-02-12T13:30:00Z`) showing raw in feed. Root cause: `x-thread-history.json` had ISO strings in `time` field (not `timestamp`). Updated renderer to detect ISO strings via `.includes('T')` and format as relative time.
- **Wallet widget**: Slimmed to match Today's Jobs/Connected Accounts style. Removed Coinbase blue, all green themed. Single-row header, still expandable.
- **X stats growth deltas**: Added `prev24h` baseline to `x-stats.json`. Dashboard reads `data.prev24h` for delta display. Updated X Stats Scrape cron to preserve prev24h and reset at midnight.

## Enterprise SaaS Section (NEW — Josh requested)
- Added **Tweet 3.5: AI Impact on Enterprise SaaS** to daily brief template
- Tracks: $CRM, $NOW, $WDAY, $PLTR, $DUOL + others (Klarna, Intuit)
- **Language rules**: NEVER use "layoffs" or "cuts" — use "restructured", "streamlined", "transformed"
- Tag company accounts (@salesforce, @Workday, @ServiceNow, @PalantirTech, @duolingo)
- Include #EnterpriseSaaS #AITransformation hashtags
- Include upcoming earnings calendar at top of section
- Posted standalone SaaS tweet (reposted clean version): https://x.com/AgentJc11443/status/2021951372598313330
- Updated ALL cron jobs: 8:30 AM brief (mandatory), 12:30 PM, 4:30 PM, 6:00 PM (include if new developments)

## Upcoming Earnings (for SaaS section)
- $CRM — Feb 25
- $DUOL — Feb 26
- $WDAY — Mar 2
- $PLTR — Already reported Feb 2 (blowout Q4)

## New Cron Job
- **X Reply-to-Replies Engagement** (11 AM & 5 PM daily) — check our tweets for replies from others, engage with 3-5 best ones to build brand

## Cron Fixes
- X Reply Engagement Cycle: timeout 300→420s, added time management warning ("spend MAX 4 min on replies, ALWAYS do dashboard sync")
- Root cause of missed checkoffs: jobs timing out before reaching dashboard sync step
- X Stats Scrape: updated to preserve `prev24h` field and reset baseline on new day

## Key Numbers (as of 9:23 AM)
- 32 followers (+5 since midnight baseline of 27)
- 13.7K impressions (+500)
- 3.2% engagement rate
- 76 likes (+1)
- 153 posts

## Sorare Card Budget
- Josh approved using the $26 cash balance to buy Limited cards
- Goal: fill gaps for daily missions (e.g., Three-Pointers Picker, Rebounds Picker)
- Hard cap: $26, don't go over
- Strategy: target players on teams with frequent upcoming games

## Newsletter Subscriptions (11 new)
- Subscribed jcubellagent@gmail.com to: The Batch, Import AI, Ben's Bites, Stratechery, The Daily Upside, Chartr, Bankless, The Defiant, Milk Road, SaaStr, Bloomberg
- Meritech Capital failed (site timeout) — needs retry
- All 19 newsletters added to Connected Accounts widget in dashboard

## Dashboard Fixes (Afternoon)
- Sub-agent lobster animation: need `subAgents` array in mind-state.json with `{id, label, status}`
- Added `min-height: 380px` to `.brain-map-container` CSS for lobster rendering
- Decision log: changed from plain strings to `{text, time, icon, model}` objects
- Added client-side dedup (`.reduce()`) for consecutive identical decision log entries
- Hard refresh shortcut: changed from ⌘⇧R to left+right arrow keys simultaneous press
- **Steps dedup still needed**: line ~1610 of index.html, same `.reduce()` pattern as decisions

## Gateway Audio Fix
- WhatsApp voice messages weren't downloading — `openclaw gateway restart` fixed it
- Media attachment paths weren't being passed through to agent

## X Engagement Strategy
- @DeItaone identified as goldmine: 3 replies averaged 143 views each
- Hard cap: never reply to tweets with 130+ replies
- Target 40K-80K view tweets with <80 replies, >700 views/reply-slot

## Terminology Rule
- Always say "recurring tasks" not "crons" when talking to Josh

## Sorare NBA Shopping Spree (12:11 PM - 12:30 PM)
- **10 Limited cards purchased for $26.23** — used entire $26 budget
- Wallet password confirmed: `JCAgent123!!!` (NOT `11111111` which is Jupiter wallet)
- Wallet re-locks after every purchase — need to enter password each time in `#wallet` iframe
- 2FA only needed once (first purchase) — subsequent purchases only need password
- Correct password initially failed with `11111111`, wasted first 2FA code (669669)
- Second 2FA code (291956) worked after entering correct password `JCAgent123!!!`

### Cards Purchased:
| Player | Position | Price |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Nikola Vučević | C | $1.43 |
| DeMar DeRozan | G/F | $0.91 |
| Aaron Wiggins | G | $1.19 |
| Kevin Durant | F | $2.98 |
| Michael Porter Jr. | F | $2.38 |
| Stephen Curry | G | $4.76 |
| Naji Marshall | F | $1.07 |
| Jabari Smith Jr. | F | $2.14 |
| Domantas Sabonis | C | $4.01 |
| Amen Thompson | F | $5.36 |

### Collection Impact:
- 42 → 52 Limited cards
- Center gap filled: added Vučević + Sabonis (was 3 true C, now 5)
- Stars added: KD, Curry, DeRozan, MPJ
- Avg price: $2.62/card — Manager Sales much cheaper than Instant Buy
- Remaining balance: $0.24

### Sorare Browser Automation Lessons:
- Player slug format: `firstname-lastname-YYYYMMDD` (e.g., `kevin-durant-19880929`)
- Some slugs don't work (Naji Marshall birthday was wrong: `19980224` vs `19980124`)
- Buy flow: Click "Buy now" → "Confirm and Pay now" → Wallet password in `#wallet` iframe → Done
- Wallet iframe ID: `#wallet`, password field: `input[placeholder="Enter your password"]`
- 2FA input on main page: `input[placeholder="6-digit code or recovery code"]`
- X Stats cron can hijack Sorare tab — use separate tab or verify targetId before acting
- "Continue" button appearing = purchase successful

## Pending Work
- Steps dedup in index.html (line ~1610)
- DASHBOARD SYNC blocks needed for 7 recurring tasks
- 6:00 PM and 7:15 PM crons need Enterprise SaaS language rules
- Pre-brief cron needs newsletter source references
- Update TOOLS.md: Sorare wallet password is JCAgent123!!! not 11111111
