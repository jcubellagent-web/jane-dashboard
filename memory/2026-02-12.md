# 2026-02-12 — Late Night Session (TikTok Hashtag Fix)

## TikTok Hashtag Issue
- **Problem**: All 4 TikTok posts had hashtags as plain text (not clickable `<a>` links). Other creators' hashtags render as linked `<a href="/tag/...">` elements.
- **Root cause**: When uploading via browser automation, hashtags pasted/typed into TikTok Studio's DraftJS editor don't get registered as proper hashtag entities. TikTok requires hashtags to be entered via the autocomplete dropdown to create linked tags.
- **Attempted fixes**:
  1. Playwright `setInputFiles` — reports success but files not actually set on TikTok's React file input
  2. React `onChange` injection — works but can't get video file into browser JS context (CORS blocks localhost fetch from tiktok.com domain)
  3. DraftJS text editor manipulation — `type` action replaces content unpredictably, `slowly` option times out
  4. Mobile user-agent trick — TikTok still serves desktop Studio
  5. iPhone/Android emulator — none installed on Mac Mini
- **Resolution**: Josh uploaded the 4 videos manually from TikTok mobile app where hashtag autocomplete works natively

## TikTok Account
- Josh added his phone number (+17175759384) as 2FA on the jcubellagent@gmail.com Google account (needed to log into TikTok mobile app)
- Login method: "Continue with Google" → jcubellagent@gmail.com

## Key Lessons
- **TikTok Studio file upload**: Playwright's `setInputFiles` doesn't work — React's custom onChange handler ignores programmatic file setting. Need alternative upload method.
- **TikTok hashtag linking**: MUST use autocomplete selection in the description editor. Plain text `#hashtag` stays as plain text.
- **Future fix needed**: Install Android emulator (Android Studio + SDK) for reliable TikTok mobile automation, OR find a way to trigger TikTok's React file upload handler programmatically.
- **Browser tool timeout**: Fixed at 20s — can't do large file fetches in evaluate calls.

## Video Status (end of night)
