# 2026-02-12 — Morning Session Notes

## Dashboard Fixes
- **Brain SVG**: Removed `scaleY(1.4)` stretch, reshaped nodes into diamond pattern (Ethereum logo style). Nodes at dy: ±130 (top/bottom), ±70 (upper/lower), 0 (mid). ViewBox adjusted to `-10 20 220 380`.
- **X tweet timestamps**: Fixed ISO timestamps (`2026-02-12T13:30:00Z`) showing raw in feed. Root cause: `x-thread-history.json` had ISO strings in `time` field (not `timestamp`). Updated renderer to detect ISO strings via `.includes('T')` and format as relative time.
- **Wallet widget**: Slimmed to match Today's Jobs/Connected Accounts style. Removed Coinbase blue, all green themed. Single-row header, still expandable.
- **X stats growth deltas**: Added `prev24h` baseline to `x-stats.json`. Dashboard reads `data.prev24h` for delta display. Updated X Stats Scrape cron to preserve prev24h and reset at midnight.

- Added **Tweet 3.5: AI Impact on Enterprise SaaS** to daily brief template

## Cron Fixes
