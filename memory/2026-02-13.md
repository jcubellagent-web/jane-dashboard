# 2026-02-13 — Recovery Day + Android Emulator Setup

## Rate Limiting Outage
- Hit Anthropic 429 rate limits from ~9 PM Feb 12 through ~9 AM Feb 13 (~12 hours)
- ALL cron jobs failed overnight — every single one returned 429
- Gateway cron API was also unresponsive (timing out on all RPC calls)
- Fixed by restarting gateway via `openclaw gateway restart`
- After restart, all crons resumed normally

## Morning Catchup
- Morning brief posted via manually spawned sub-agent (cron timed out)
- Possible duplicate brief issue — sub-agent + cron may have both posted after restart
- **Lesson**: When manually running a brief, disable the cron first to prevent overlap
- macOS update rescheduled to 3 AM Feb 14 (job id: b4b56204)
- Audited all cron-schedule.json entries for accuracy

## Dashboard Fix
- Fixed mind widget text overflow — changed `.mind-widget` from `overflow: hidden` to `overflow-y: auto`
- Josh reported "Thinking & Decisions" text getting cut off on desktop

## Android Emulator Setup (for TikTok automation)
- **Installed**: Android CLI tools (Homebrew), OpenJDK 17, Android SDK, emulator, system image (android-35, Google Play Store, arm64-v8a)
- **Created AVD**: TikTok_Phone (Pixel 6, Android 15)
- **TikTok installed**: Downloaded 457MB APK from apkpure, `adb install` succeeded
- **No emulator detection** — TikTok runs fine on the emulator!
- **Google sign-in BLOCKED**: After multiple attempts, Google locked out SMS verification ("too many failed attempts, try again in a few hours")
- Also tried account recovery flow — Google ultimately said "couldn't sign you in" from unfamiliar device
- Set reminder to retry at 12:30 PM ET
- **Env vars added to ~/.zshrc**: JAVA_HOME, ANDROID_HOME, ANDROID_SDK_ROOT, PATH updates
- **Emulator launch command**: `nohup emulator -avd TikTok_Phone -no-window -no-audio -gpu swiftshader_indirect -no-metrics > /tmp/emulator.log 2>&1 &`

### ADB Tips Learned
- `adb shell input text` doesn't handle `@` well — use `input keyevent 77` for @ symbol
- `adb shell input text` with special chars can fail — type in segments
- `adb shell uiautomator dump` + python parsing for finding UI elements
- Always verify field positions before typing — screens shift when keyboard appears
- `adb exec-out screencap -p > file.png` for screenshots

## TikTok Videos Generated
- Created 3 new v4 videos: rate-limited, valentine, emulator-saga
- Sent to Josh via WhatsApp with captions for manual posting
- Video generator: `tiktok/generate-video-v4.py` reads from `tiktok/video-scripts.json`

## X Engagement Insights (from feedback loop)
- 42 followers (+6 in 24h)
- Best reach: replies to @DeItaone (66K view tweets) = 80 views for us
- mfer community replies generate actual conversations
- Zero likes on all replies — need punchier opening lines
- Thread decay severe — lead tweet 60 views, crypto section only 6
- Strategy: target 20K-70K view tweets, lead with punchy takes, front-load best content

## Key Lessons
- Gateway restart fixes cron API timeouts
- `gateway restart` needs `commands.restart=true` in config — use `openclaw gateway restart` CLI instead
- When rate limited, cron jobs silently fail (429) — need to audit on recovery
- Google is very suspicious of emulator sign-ins — may need to establish trust first via Chrome/Settings before app-level OAuth
