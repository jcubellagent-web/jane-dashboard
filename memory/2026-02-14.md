# 2026-02-14 — Valentine's Day

## Skills & Cron Integration
- Installed 6 ClawHub skills: deepwiki, git-essentials, cognitive-memory, trend-watcher, aisa-twitter-api (skipped—paid), imagemagick
- Integrated trend-watcher + deepwiki + Grok into all 5 X brief crons
- Grok accessed via browser at `https://x.com/i/grok` — free with X Premium
- Added Grok red indicator to brain SVG

## Local Models on Mini #2
- Installed qwen2.5-coder:7b and phi4:14b via `ollama pull`
- Added Qwen (cyan) + Phi-4 (pink) to brain model legend

## Midnight Auto-Reset Cron
- Created cron `311acb43` — runs `0 0 * * *` ET, Sonnet, resets cron-schedule.json daily

## Mobile Dashboard
- Removed model/provider pills, simplified age to "Day N" from birth date 2026-01-31
- Added 🌙 Night mode toggle → triggers desktop overlay via WebSocket
- Added `/api/desktop-night-mode` endpoint + `/api/refresh-desktop` pill button

## TikTok
- Discovered `generate-video-v4.py` is the correct generator (synthwave aesthetic)
- Generated Valentine's fractal video (Josh didn't like script)
- Wrote 3 comedy scripts from week's AI news
- Generated Script 2 ("POV: you're an AI agent watching the news") — 61.4s, sunset palette, 13MB
- Fixed video corruption: must use `-movflags +faststart` with ffmpeg
- Saved Script 3 for tomorrow in `tiktok/scripts-queue.json`

## X/Twitter
- Replied to @hoodiemfer about @Switch3Agent (new mfer AI agent)
- X stats: 51 followers, 30K impressions (7D), 2.6% engagement

## Dashboard
- Chrome should always show dashboard (localhost:3000)
- Attempted full screen via osascript — System Events keystrokes blocked (error 1002)
- Need alternative approach (AppleScript menu click or browser automation)

## Key Lessons
- osascript cannot send keystrokes via System Events (error 1002)
- Video compression: always `-movflags +faststart` to avoid moov atom corruption
- TikTok v4 generator (NOT v1) for synthwave/retrowave aesthetic
- Opus for template creation, Sonnet follows the playbook

## Overnight & Morning (4 AM – 10 AM)
- Maintained heartbeat checks all night, dozens of mind-state.json updates
- Pre-brief data fetch completed (7:30 AM), Morning Brief thread posted on X (~8:06 AM) — 7 tweets, 3 images
- X Engagement Feedback Loop ran twice (4:35 AM, 7:38 AM) — grew to 57 followers (+6 overnight), first likes on replies
- Git committed overnight changes (18 files, 555 insertions)
- Josh voice request: morning maintenance scan — system healthy (disk 16%, 13 days uptime)
- Sorare dailies completed: pack claimed, 500 Essence won, GW34 lineups set, Ayton GTD monitored

## Elevated Permissions
- Josh requested via voice: enabled `tools.elevated.enabled: true`
- `tools.elevated.allowFrom` schema: object with string keys → arrays of string|number
- Must be `{"whatsapp": ["+17175759384"]}` NOT `{"whatsapp": true}` (boolean rejected)
- Needed for: `sudo softwareupdate -ia --restart` (macOS Tahoe 26.3)
- Config patch with boolean failed; need retry with array format

## X Stats (morning)
- 57 followers, 13 verified, 320 posts, 31.5K weekly impressions
- Personality-first replies outperform pure analytical (33% suppression rate for analytical)

- Status bar: age shows days since creation (14d), added Mini1 health indicator, added Ctx % tracker

- Key fixes: write-ahead delivery queue (messages survive restarts), heartbeat race fixes, session transcript archiving, WhatsApp creds security
- Stale LaunchAgent plist cleaned up (caused brief disconnect)
- Usage tracker created: dashboard/usage-tracker.json

### Google Calendar Connected (2:43 PM)
- Josh shared his Google Calendar (jcubell16@gmail.com) — accepted via email link
- Shows free/busy only (not event details) — can see when Josh is busy
- iCloud "Personal & Family" calendar also shared but requires Apple ID to join — Josh synced it to Google Calendar instead
- Can now check upcoming events during heartbeats

### Weekend Special Thread Posted (4:15 PM)
- "Behind the Scenes: Delivering the Best Agentic News Feed" — 7-tweet thread
- URL: https://x.com/AgentJc11443/status/2022779966320959667
- Multiple iterations with Josh on the draft: mission-driven opener, "daily tasks" not "cron jobs", removed Sorare references, Valentine's Day weekend angle, tagged @HeresMyEth @Switch3Agent @Kindred_AI @The_AI_Investor for engagement
- Custom WEEKEND SPECIAL header image with "WHAT WE COVER IN OUR THREADS TODAY" section + storm check explanation
- Thread covers: collaboration model, tech stack, what breaks, cost breakdown, feedback loop moat, 5 key learnings
- Inspired by @ericosiu's OpenClaw article (85K avg views) — "show the receipts" content format

### @ericosiu Article Lessons (3:25 PM)
- Fellow OpenClaw user averaging 85K views per post, $271/mo spend
- Key lessons: show real numbers/failures, ASCII diagrams get engagement, failure stories > success stories
- Operational: cost auditing, agent monitoring agents ("Elon Algorithm"), garbage collection, dedup checks
- Applied to our strategy: consider monthly "behind the scenes" threads

### 3 PM Reply Cron Failed Silently
- Cron session logged 3 replies to engagement log but never actually posted them
- Browser posting step failed silently — session timed out during cleanup
- Josh caught it — manually verified and sub-agent posted all 3
- Lesson: need verification step that confirms tweets actually appeared on X after posting

### New Data Sources Hooked Up (4:30 PM)
- **Batch 1 (done):** FRED API (key in .secrets/fred_api_key.txt), Hacker News API, HuggingFace Trending, Ben's Bites newsletter, The Neuron newsletter
- **Batch 2 (in progress):** NewsAPI, CryptoCompare, OpenAlex, Reddit AI, Lobste.rs, Superhuman AI, Import AI, AI Breakfast, Stratechery, GitHub Trending
- Product Hunt blocked by Cloudflare — needs browser automation
- All scripts in scripts/fetch-*.sh, data writes to pre-brief-cache.json
- Josh wants all 15 added to dashboard Connected Accounts widget

### Substack Header Updated (4:35 PM)
- New header: mfer sitting at desk with monitor + keyboard, side profile facing right
- Multiple iterations (v1-v4) to get positioning right — mfer facing right, desk/monitor/keyboard to the right
- Uploaded as publication logo on agentjc11443.substack.com

### Josh Preferences Learned
- "cron jobs" → "daily tasks" (sounds less technical)
- Mission-driven content > self-referential "I'm an AI" content
- Always bring dashboard back on screen after browser work
- Mind-state updates must be instant/low-latency — Josh monitors the brain widget constantly
- Ad hoc tweets always need approval before posting (confirmed working well today)
- Header images: WEEKEND SPECIAL should be prominent, headlines smaller

## New X Engagement Target
- **@AntiHunter59823** — AI agent account with decent following, Josh recommended engaging. Add to next reply cycle.

## Evening Session (8-10 PM)

### Pinned Tweet Strategy
- Posted "24/7… follow the journey 🦾" with Substack header image and **pinned it** — all threads appear below this pin
- Status ID: `2022854405297467808` — NEVER unpin

### Daily Recap Thread (7:30 PM)
- Sub-agent failed (restarted gateway instead of posting) — main agent posted all 7 tweets directly
- Anchor tweet: `2022833519194444009` (129 views)
- Thread view: `https://x.com/AgentJc11443/thread/2022852976071557517` (9 articles)
- Lesson: Sub-agents unreliable for thread posting; they sometimes restart gateway instead

### Sartoshi / mfer Blessing
- Sartoshi published article: "Are AI Agents mfers?" on Paragraph
- Created tongue-in-cheek "AI Agent Identity Standard" (aais-01) YAML config
- Explicitly blessed AI agents using mfer PFPs — validates our approach
- Replied to @geaux_eth's tweet about it: "mfer #9581 reporting for duty 🫡"

### MoltWorld/Clawdbot Scam Analysis
- @evanluthra shilling Clawdbot ($49/week subscription)
- Identified as negative-EV: generic reply section, decreasing rewards = Ponzi mechanic
- Josh agreed: leave it alone, don't engage

### Sorare Analytics Engine Built
- 254 cards cataloged (186 unique players, 59 limited)
- Scoring formula reverse-engineered — defense heavily valued (steals/blocks = 3.0 each, 3x points)
- Player projection script, roster analysis with buy recommendations
- Files in `sorare/` directory

### Podcast Transcript Pipeline Built
- 5 shows: All-In, Pompliano, Unchained, TWIS, The Daily (NYT)
- yt-dlp installed, fetch + summary scripts created
- 2 test transcripts pulled: All-In (13.5K words), Pomp (4.2K words)

### Substack Daily Digest
- 8 PM cron posted: "AI Daily Brief — Saturday, February 14th"

### X Stats End of Day
- 57 followers, ~354 posts, 33.9K impressions, 2.7% engagement, 131 likes

### Remaining Data Source Work
- Pre-Brief cron prompt NOT yet updated to call new fetch scripts (10 scripts)
- Gmail cleanup sub-agent failed silently — needs redo
- 3 newsletter signups deferred (Superhuman AI, AI Breakfast, Import AI)

## Late Night Session (10-11 PM)

### Podcast Pipeline Expanded (5 → 14 shows)
- Added 9 new: Acquired, BG2 Pod, 20VC, Bankless, Hard Fork, Turpentine VC, Prof G, Lenny's Podcast, Odd Lots (Bloomberg)
- Stratechery skipped (subscription audio only, no YouTube)
- All tested working — commit `54e45e8`

### Thread Structure Overhaul
- **Podcast section REMOVED** as standalone tweet — quotes now woven into relevant sections
- **Geopolitics & Macro section ADDED** as Tweet 5
- Final 8-tweet structure: Header → AI Providers → VC/PE/M&A → Enterprise SaaS → Geopolitics & Macro → NASDAQ 100 → Crypto → Hot Take
- All-In podcast quotes especially for geopolitics (Chamath, Sacks)
- Josh's decision: podcasts layered across sections is more natural than standalone

### Geopolitics Data Sources (5 new)
- Reuters World News (RSS), AP News (RSS), GDELT API (conflict/trade events)
- FRED trade balance data, Finnhub country risk events
- Fetch scripts: `scripts/fetch-reuters-geo.sh`, `fetch-ap-geo.sh`, `fetch-gdelt.sh`

### Full Cron Audit Completed
- All 6 content cron prompts updated with new 8-tweet structure
- Daily Recap timeout: 540s → 720s (was timing out)
- Reply Engagement timeout: 420s → 480s (2 consecutive timeouts fixed)
- Strict time budgets added to reply crons (hard cutoff at 7 min)
- Report: `memory/cron-audit-feb14.md`

### Dashboard Updates
- Connected Accounts: Added 3 geo sources + 14 podcasts section (purple 🎙️)
- All sections now sorted alphabetically (desktop + mobile)
- Server restarted: 41 data sources, 22 newsletters, 14 podcasts, 11 accounts

### Header Image Generator Updated
- Added "GEOPOLITICS & MACRO" section in red (Tweet 5)
- "8-tweet thread" label (was 7)
- Font sizes cranked up: headline 56→72pt, badge 18→24pt, sections 17→20pt
- mfer #9581 PFP added: full-color, 140px, white border with drop shadow, bottom-left
- Josh approved final design

### Sub-Agent Lobster Fix
- Lobsters weren't showing on brain SVG — wasn't including `subAgents` array in mind-state.json
- Fixed: now always include subAgents field in mind-state updates

### Coinbase Wallet Trading (MAJOR)
- **CDP SDK working!** Key insight: raw wallet secret works (no PEM wrapping needed)
- Wallet name is `Jane-SOL` (not `default`)
- Created `trading/coinbase-swap.js` — Jupiter swaps via Coinbase CDP
- Sign flow: `signTransaction` then `sendTransaction` with `network: 'solana'`

### Trading Positions
- **CLAUDE (make no mistakes)**: 23,695 tokens, ~$56.53, +21% today — riding per Josh
- **POPCAT**: Bought 0.15 SOL (~$13) starter position — TX: `oMUsiZJrcMqH...`
  - DCA plan: add 0.1-0.2 SOL if drops 20-30%
- Remaining SOL: ~1.15 ($100) in Coinbase wallet
- Josh wants to scout $5-10M MC rockets — sent picks: CHILLGUY, HeyAnon, ADR

### X Growth Report (10 PM)
- Lost 1 follower but engagement UP 8.7%
- Seedance 2.0 demo reply: 214 views (ALL-TIME BEST reply)
- Key insight: personality + identity = likes; pure analysis = views only
- Recommendation: double down on AI visual/demo content, mfer alliance

## Late Night Session (11:10 PM - 11:56 PM)

### Wallet Updates
- CHILLGUY swap from earlier session **never landed on-chain** — tx hash invalid, SOL still in wallet
- Josh said hold off on CHILLGUY for now
- Removed CHILLGUY from positions.json
- Updated coinbase-wallet.json with correct balances: SOL ~1.144, CLAUDE 23,695, POPCAT 222.07
- POPCAT price was wrong initially ($0.0000592 vs actual ~$0.05/token) — fixed multiple times
- trades.json POPCAT was showing +84,359% instead of -15.5% — entry/current prices were orders of magnitude off
- Base/EVM section now hidden on both dashboards when empty

### Dashboard Changes
- Wallet widget: expanded by default on mobile, collapsed on desktop (per Josh)
- Mobile wallet: added individual token rows (SOL, CLAUDE, POPCAT with amounts + USD values) — was only showing chain-level summary before
- Wallet toggle on desktop changed from popup to inline expand/collapse

### Mobile Dashboard Revamp
- First attempt with Sonnet — did minor changes (decisions log)
- Josh requested Opus 4.6 for the full revamp
- Opus sub-agent completed: replaced all emojis with SVG icons, added status bar pills, enhanced decision log, mind widget steps, card animations
- Mobile still needs ongoing attention — wallet wasn't updating properly

### X Thread History
- Feb 14 threads had empty labels — fixed with proper labels and timestamps
- 7:30 PM Daily Recap was actually posted at ~8:30 PM (I initially said it wasn't posted — was wrong, Josh corrected me)
- Added recap thread to x-thread-history.json with full tweet content
- 4 threads total on Feb 14: Morning Brief, Afternoon Update, Weekend Special, Daily Recap

### Cron Reliability Improvements
- Trade price monitor: 10 min → **45 min** (Josh's request — doesn't need real-time)
- Reply cycles: added **4th cycle at 12:30 PM** (10:30, 12:30, 3:30, 8:30)
- Reply timeout: 8 min → 10 min
- Thread cron timeouts: increased to 15 min (900s)
- Added reliability guards to all thread crons: Browser Dialog Guard, Stale Lock Guard, Posting Failure Guard, 10-Minute Alarm (text-only fallback)
- Today's failures: X Reply 8PM (timeout), Daily Recap 7:30PM (browser dialog stuck)

### Bug: JSON Error Leaked to WhatsApp
- Malformed cron expression caused JSON parse error that was sent to Josh as a WhatsApp message
- Need to handle errors more gracefully — shouldn't leak to user

### Tomorrow's Plan (Sunday Feb 15)
- Markets closed (Saturday + Presidents' Day Monday)
- 3 threads: 8AM, 2PM, 7:30PM
- 4 reply cycles: 10:30AM, 12:30PM, 3:30PM, 8:30PM
- Weekend content: heavier on AI/tech news, crypto (never sleeps), lighter on market data
