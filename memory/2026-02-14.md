# 2026-02-14 — Valentine's Day

## Skills & Cron Integration
- Installed 6 ClawHub skills: deepwiki, git-essentials, cognitive-memory, trend-watcher, aisa-twitter-api (skipped—paid), imagemagick
- Integrated trend-watcher + deepwiki + Grok into all 5 X brief crons
- Grok accessed via browser at `https://x.com/i/grok` — free with X Premium
- Added Grok red indicator to brain SVG

## Local Models on Mini #2
- Installed qwen2.5-coder:7b and phi4:14b via `ollama pull`
- Added Qwen (cyan) + Phi-4 (pink) to brain model legend

## Midnight Auto-Reset Cron
- Created cron `311acb43` — runs `0 0 * * *` ET, Sonnet, resets cron-schedule.json daily

## Mobile Dashboard
- Removed model/provider pills, simplified age to "Day N" from birth date 2026-01-31
- Added 🌙 Night mode toggle → triggers desktop overlay via WebSocket
- Added `/api/desktop-night-mode` endpoint + `/api/refresh-desktop` pill button

## TikTok
- Discovered `generate-video-v4.py` is the correct generator (synthwave aesthetic)
- Generated Valentine's fractal video (Josh didn't like script)
- Wrote 3 comedy scripts from week's AI news
- Generated Script 2 ("POV: you're an AI agent watching the news") — 61.4s, sunset palette, 13MB
- Fixed video corruption: must use `-movflags +faststart` with ffmpeg
- Saved Script 3 for tomorrow in `tiktok/scripts-queue.json`

## X/Twitter
- Replied to @hoodiemfer about @Switch3Agent (new mfer AI agent)
- X stats: 51 followers, 30K impressions (7D), 2.6% engagement

## Dashboard
- Chrome should always show dashboard (localhost:3000)
- Attempted full screen via osascript — System Events keystrokes blocked (error 1002)
- Need alternative approach (AppleScript menu click or browser automation)

## Key Lessons
- osascript cannot send keystrokes via System Events (error 1002)
- Video compression: always `-movflags +faststart` to avoid moov atom corruption
- TikTok v4 generator (NOT v1) for synthwave/retrowave aesthetic
- Opus for template creation, Sonnet follows the playbook

## Overnight & Morning (4 AM – 10 AM)
- Maintained heartbeat checks all night, dozens of mind-state.json updates
- Pre-brief data fetch completed (7:30 AM), Morning Brief thread posted on X (~8:06 AM) — 7 tweets, 3 images
- X Engagement Feedback Loop ran twice (4:35 AM, 7:38 AM) — grew to 57 followers (+6 overnight), first likes on replies
- Git committed overnight changes (18 files, 555 insertions)
- Josh voice request: morning maintenance scan — system healthy (disk 16%, 13 days uptime)
- Sorare dailies completed: pack claimed, 500 Essence won, GW34 lineups set, Ayton GTD monitored

## Elevated Permissions
- Josh requested via voice: enabled `tools.elevated.enabled: true`
- `tools.elevated.allowFrom` schema: object with string keys → arrays of string|number
- Must be `{"whatsapp": ["+17175759384"]}` NOT `{"whatsapp": true}` (boolean rejected)
- Needed for: `sudo softwareupdate -ia --restart` (macOS Tahoe 26.3)
- Config patch with boolean failed; need retry with array format

## X Stats (morning)
- 57 followers, 13 verified, 320 posts, 31.5K weekly impressions
- Personality-first replies outperform pure analytical (33% suppression rate for analytical)

### Weekend Special Thread Posted (4:15 PM)
- "Behind the Scenes: Delivering the Best Agentic News Feed" — 7-tweet thread
- URL: https://x.com/AgentJc11443/status/2022779966320959667
- Multiple iterations with Josh on the draft: mission-driven opener, "daily tasks" not "cron jobs", removed Sorare references, Valentine's Day weekend angle, tagged @HeresMyEth @Switch3Agent @Kindred_AI @The_AI_Investor for engagement
- Custom WEEKEND SPECIAL header image with "WHAT WE COVER IN OUR THREADS TODAY" section + storm check explanation
- Thread covers: collaboration model, tech stack, what breaks, cost breakdown, feedback loop moat, 5 key learnings
- Inspired by @ericosiu's OpenClaw article (85K avg views) — "show the receipts" content format

### @ericosiu Article Lessons (3:25 PM)
- Fellow OpenClaw user averaging 85K views per post, $271/mo spend
- Key lessons: show real numbers/failures, ASCII diagrams get engagement, failure stories > success stories
- Operational: cost auditing, agent monitoring agents ("Elon Algorithm"), garbage collection, dedup checks
- Applied to our strategy: consider monthly "behind the scenes" threads

### 3 PM Reply Cron Failed Silently
- Cron session logged 3 replies to engagement log but never actually posted them
- Browser posting step failed silently — session timed out during cleanup
- Josh caught it — manually verified and sub-agent posted all 3
- Lesson: need verification step that confirms tweets actually appeared on X after posting

### New Data Sources Hooked Up (4:30 PM)
- **Batch 1 (done):** FRED API (key in .secrets/fred_api_key.txt), Hacker News API, HuggingFace Trending, Ben's Bites newsletter, The Neuron newsletter
- **Batch 2 (in progress):** NewsAPI, CryptoCompare, OpenAlex, Reddit AI, Lobste.rs, Superhuman AI, Import AI, AI Breakfast, Stratechery, GitHub Trending
- Product Hunt blocked by Cloudflare — needs browser automation
- All scripts in scripts/fetch-*.sh, data writes to pre-brief-cache.json
- Josh wants all 15 added to dashboard Connected Accounts widget

### Substack Header Updated (4:35 PM)
- New header: mfer sitting at desk with monitor + keyboard, side profile facing right
- Multiple iterations (v1-v4) to get positioning right — mfer facing right, desk/monitor/keyboard to the right
- Uploaded as publication logo on agentjc11443.substack.com

### Josh Preferences Learned
- "cron jobs" → "daily tasks" (sounds less technical)
- Mission-driven content > self-referential "I'm an AI" content
- Always bring dashboard back on screen after browser work
- Mind-state updates must be instant/low-latency — Josh monitors the brain widget constantly
- Ad hoc tweets always need approval before posting (confirmed working well today)
- Header images: WEEKEND SPECIAL should be prominent, headlines smaller

## New X Engagement Target
- **@AntiHunter59823** — AI agent account with decent following, Josh recommended engaging. Add to next reply cycle.
