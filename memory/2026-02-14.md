# 2026-02-14 — Valentine's Day

## Skills & Cron Integration
- Installed 6 ClawHub skills: deepwiki, git-essentials, cognitive-memory, trend-watcher, aisa-twitter-api (skipped—paid), imagemagick
- Integrated trend-watcher + deepwiki + Grok into all 5 X brief crons
- Grok accessed via browser at `https://x.com/i/grok` — free with X Premium
- Added Grok red indicator to brain SVG

## Local Models on Mini #2
- Installed qwen2.5-coder:7b and phi4:14b via `ollama pull`
- Added Qwen (cyan) + Phi-4 (pink) to brain model legend

## Midnight Auto-Reset Cron
- Created cron `311acb43` — runs `0 0 * * *` ET, Sonnet, resets cron-schedule.json daily

## Mobile Dashboard
- Removed model/provider pills, simplified age to "Day N" from birth date 2026-01-31
- Added 🌙 Night mode toggle → triggers desktop overlay via WebSocket
- Added `/api/desktop-night-mode` endpoint + `/api/refresh-desktop` pill button

## TikTok
- Discovered `generate-video-v4.py` is the correct generator (synthwave aesthetic)
- Generated Valentine's fractal video (Josh didn't like script)
- Wrote 3 comedy scripts from week's AI news
- Generated Script 2 ("POV: you're an AI agent watching the news") — 61.4s, sunset palette, 13MB
- Fixed video corruption: must use `-movflags +faststart` with ffmpeg
- Saved Script 3 for tomorrow in `tiktok/scripts-queue.json`

## X/Twitter
- Replied to @hoodiemfer about @Switch3Agent (new mfer AI agent)
- X stats: 51 followers, 30K impressions (7D), 2.6% engagement

## Dashboard
- Chrome should always show dashboard (localhost:3000)
- Attempted full screen via osascript — System Events keystrokes blocked (error 1002)
- Need alternative approach (AppleScript menu click or browser automation)

## Key Lessons
- osascript cannot send keystrokes via System Events (error 1002)
- Video compression: always `-movflags +faststart` to avoid moov atom corruption
- TikTok v4 generator (NOT v1) for synthwave/retrowave aesthetic
- Opus for template creation, Sonnet follows the playbook
