# 2026-02-15 (Sunday)

## OpenClaw Update
- Updated from 2026.2.13 → 2026.2.14
- Key fixes: cron announce delivery on timeout, memory leak patches for 24/7 running, media path fixes

## Resilience Improvements
- X Reply Engagement cron: added stale lock guard + bumped timeout 600→900s
- X Daily Recap cron: had 1 consecutive timeout error (will self-reset)
- Added weekly gateway restart cron: Sundays 4 AM ET (id: 64e70fd4)
- X Reply cron had 2 consecutive timeouts from browser CDP issues

## Dashboard Changes
- **Mobile wallet widget**: slimmed down, collapsed by default, shows balance + 24h % change, tap to expand
- **Desktop wallet widget**: same treatment — collapsed by default, 24h % badge in header, compact trades hidden when collapsed
- **X stats pills (desktop)**: tightened — smaller fonts (0.9→0.75rem vals, 0.7→0.6rem labels), reduced padding/gaps
- **X growth deltas**: moved inline (right of value) instead of stacked below — saves vertical space
- **Brain SVG data flow**: added active-state animations for brain-lines (dashed flowing outward) and nodes (pulse/glow on receive) with staggered delays
- **Sub-agent lobsters**: fixed — need to include `subAgents` array in mind-state.json for lobsters to render. Was missing this field entirely.
- **Cron schedule label**: fixed "X Replies (10 AM)" → "X Replies (10:30 AM)" to match actual cron schedule
- **Fullscreen toggle**: `osascript` keystroke ⌃⌘F works for Chrome fullscreen after Josh granted accessibility permissions

## Calendar
- jcubell16@gmail.com shared with jcubellagent@gmail.com as "See only free/busy"
- Free/busy blocks NOT rendering in Google Calendar UI day view (known limitation of free/busy sharing in overlay view)
- Josh has a ~2 PM event today that isn't showing
- Plan: set up Google Calendar API (free, 1M queries/day) to query freebusy programmatically — tabled for later
- Josh's work calendar likely on Outlook/M365 (Nasdaq) — separate from Google

## X Thread Performance
- Morning brief posted 8:00 AM ✅ (8 tweets, Anthropic $30B lead story)
- X Replies 10:30 AM cron failed (browser CDP), manually re-ran via sub-agent — 3 replies posted (bio computing VC, NVIDIA voice AI, mfer ERC-8004)
- X Replies 12:30 PM ran successfully
- Sorare daily tasks completed 10:07 AM
- Sorare GW34 lineup set: Jokić (MVP), Edwards, Cunningham, Brown, Durant

## Josh Notes
- Heading out around 2 PM
- Calendar API setup deferred to later
- Wants sleeker/tighter UI across all widgets
