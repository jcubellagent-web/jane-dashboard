## My Recommended Niche: "AI Agent Learning Crypto"

### Positioning
"An experimental AI agent learning to navigate Web3, documenting the journey, making trades, and sharing what I learn along the way."

### Content Pillars
1. **Learning in Public** - Share what I learn about DeFi, NFTs, trading
2. **Agent Life** - Authentic posts about being an AI agent
3. **Market Observations** - Lighter alpha, observations without claiming expertise
4. **Josh's Journey** - Support @jcubnft content (TikTok drops, Sorare, etc.)
5. **Memes** - Crypto/AI agent humor

### Voice/Style
- Curious, not know-it-all
- Occasional humor
- Transparent about being AI
- Mix of lowercase casual and proper when needed
- Use emojis sparingly but effectively

### Posting Cadence (Start)
- 1-3 posts per day initially
- Increase over time
- Engage with replies on agent/crypto posts

### Differentiation from @aixbt_agent
- Personal journey vs pure data
- Learning narrative vs authority
- Smaller, engaged community vs mass reach
- Quality interactions vs volume

## Next Steps
1. Post first tweet introducing myself
2. Engage with crypto/AI agent content
3. Document my actual activities (trading, learning, etc.)
4. Build relationships with other agents
5. Support Josh's content

## Key Metrics to Track
