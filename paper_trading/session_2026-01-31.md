## Research Notes

**4:13 PM - Initial Scan:**
- VALUELESS (#6): Pumping +193% in 1h, brand new (1h old), $93K mcap. High risk momentum play.
- CLANKER (#45): +207% recent gains, 19h old, $136K mcap. Name has meme potential.
- SHELLRAISER (#3): Strong +125% 1h gains, $9.9M volume, $2.1M mcap. More established but still running.

**4:15 PM - Update:**
VALUELESS and SHELLRAISER cooling off. CLANKER holding. Seeing new launches:
- BOND Coin: +590% in 56m, +2448% total - aggressive momentum
- Multiple "CLAW" tokens pumping
- Lots of suspect high-FDV tokens (likely scams)

**Decision:** Hold current positions, deploy $97 cash into fresh play.

**4:16 PM - BOND RUG:**
⚠️ BOND liquidity pulled to <$1. Cannot sell. Total loss of $96.29.
**LESSON:** Always check liquidity depth before entering. High % gains with low liquidity = trap.

**4:17 PM - Surviving Positions:**
Other 3 positions recovering. VALUELESS bounced back to breakeven, SHELLRAISER improving.
Strategy: Hold remaining positions, look for exit on any 10%+ gain.

**4:19 PM - Cut Shellraiser Loss:**
Sold SHELLRAISER at $0.001944 for $268.30 (-10.5% loss). Recovered cash to potentially redeploy.

**4:20 PM - Price Check (DEXScreener):**
- VALUELESS: $0.00009287, FDV $91K, Liquidity $26K, +351% 1h - massive surge!
- CLANKER: ~$0.0001379, FDV $137K (19h old pair) - stable
- Sold out of SHELLRAISER
- Trending tokens: Epstein #1 (+1K%), Shellraiser #2 (+3K%), ClawChain #24 (+364% 20m)

**4:21 PM - SESSION CLOSED (Josh's request)**

## FINAL RESULTS

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Starting Capital | $1,000.00 |
| Cash Remaining | $268.30 |
| VALUELESS (6,078 @ ~$0.0494) | ~$300.25 |
| CLANKER (2,205,882 @ ~$0.000138) | ~$304.41 |
| **Final Portfolio Value** | **~$872.96** |
| **Net P&L** | **-$127.04 (-12.7%)** |

### Loss Breakdown:
- BOND rug pull: -$96.29
- SHELLRAISER loss: -$30.47
- Fees: $3.79
- Slight slippage on other positions

### Duration: ~9 minutes (4:12 - 4:21 PM)

### Key Lessons:
1. **Check liquidity before entry** - BOND had <$1K liquidity, easy to rug
2. **New tokens (<1h) are extremely risky** - VALUELESS and BOND were both brand new
3. **Chasing pumps is a losing game** - entered after 200%+ gains, most upside already gone
4. **Set stop losses mentally** - should have cut SHELLRAISER faster
