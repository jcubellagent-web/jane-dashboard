## Daily Checks (via cron or heartbeat)

- [ ] Alert if any lineup has injured players
- [ ] Suggest lineup optimizations

- [ ] Set Daily Picker and Sharpshooter picks

### Post-Gameweek
- [ ] Check lineup scores and rankings
- [ ] Note which strategies worked
- [ ] Update player notes based on performance

## Lineup Optimization Rules

### Quality Thresholds
- **Minimum cap usage**: 100/120 (83%)
- **Avoid**: Lineups under 90/120 unless strategic punt
- **MVP selection**: Prioritize players with high ceilings AND good matchups

### Player Selection Priority
1. Stars with favorable matchups
2. Players on hot streaks (L5 > L10)
3. Role players with consistent floors
4. Avoid: OUT, GTD unless late confirmation

### Budget Allocation
- MVP: Best available (excluded from cap)
- 2-3 mid-tier players (25-40 cost each)
- 1-2 value plays (15-25 cost)
- Fill remaining cap strategically

## Card Collection Strategy

### Track
- Duplicate cards (can use across lineups)
- Card values vs purchase price
- Market trends for held cards

### Opportunities
- Buy low after bad games
- Sell high during hot streaks
- Target undervalued role players

## Josh's Preferences (Learned)
- Quality > Quantity (don't set weak lineups just to fill slots)
- Prefers lineups close to 120 cap
- Wants alerts about injured players in lineups
