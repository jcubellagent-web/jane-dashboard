## 🔄 Weekly Lineup Management (Before GW Deadline)

### 1. Check Player Availability (FIRST!)
- [ ] Go to My Cards → Limited filter

- [ ] Lineup 2: _________________
- [ ] Lineup 3: _________________

## 🎯 Automation Opportunities

### What CAN be automated:
- Fetching player injury status via API
- Checking current GW and deadline
- Pulling card collection data
- Monitoring market prices
- Tracking competition results

### What CANNOT be automated (requires browser):
- Setting/editing lineups
- Making picker selections
- Buying/selling cards
- Claiming rewards

### Suggested Automation Script Flow:
```
1. Query API for current fixtures/deadlines
2. Query user cards for status (OUT/GTD)
3. Alert if deadline <6 hours and lineups not set
4. Alert if any lineup contains OUT player
5. Track Hot Streak progress
```

## 📝 Notes & Learnings

### Lineup Building Priorities:

2. **MVP selection matters** - excluded from cap in Champion/Challenger
3. **Same team limit** - max 4 players from one team
4. **In-season requirement** - min 4 in-season cards for Champion

### Value Plays (Low Cost, High Upside):
- Will Riley (17 cost, +7% bonus)
