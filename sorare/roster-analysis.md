## Strategic Assessment

### Current Strengths
1. **Large Collection Size**: 254 cards gives us good lineup flexibility
2. **Limited Cards**: 59 limited cards means we can compete in Limited Champion leagues
3. **Player Diversity**: 186 unique players provides matchup optionality

### Identified Weaknesses

#### 1. **No Premium Cards**
- **Gap**: Zero Rare, Super Rare, or Unique cards
- **Impact**: Cannot compete in premium leagues with better rewards
- **Priority**: Medium (focus on Limited leagues first)

#### 2. **Rarity Distribution**
- **Issue**: 77% common cards vs 23% limited
- **Impact**: Limited lineups need careful construction
- **Recommendation**: Acquire more budget limited cards to expand lineup options

#### 3. **Position Balance** (To be assessed from projections)
- Need to analyze position distribution
- Identify if we're weak at guard, forward, or center

#### 4. **Score Consistency** (From projections)
- Some players may have high variance (boom-or-bust)
- Need consistent scorers for reliable lineups

## Acquisition Strategy

### Budget Buys (Under $10)

#### Criteria for Recommendations:
1. **High floor** (15+ minimum score)
2. **Consistency** (low standard deviation)
3. **High minutes** (starters or 6th men)
4. **Limited rarity** (to expand Limited lineup options)
5. **Position need** (fill gaps in our roster)

#### Recommended Player Archetypes:

**1. High-Volume Rebounders (Centers/Forwards)**
- Why: Rebounds are heavily weighted (2.0 for offensive, 1.2 for defensive)
- Target stats: 10+ rebounds per game
- Examples: Backup centers on bad teams (high minutes, lots of rebounding opportunities)

**2. 3-and-D Wings**
- Why: Points + steals = consistent floor
- Target stats: 12+ points, 1+ steals per game
- Low turnovers (avoid the -2 penalty)

**3. High-Assist Guards**
- Why: Assists worth 2.0 points each
- Target stats: 6+ assists per game
- Examples: Starting point guards on fast-paced teams

**4. Elite Defenders**
- Why: Steals/blocks worth 3.0 points each
- Target stats: 2+ steals+blocks combined per game
- Often undervalued in Sorare market

**5. Double-Double Specialists**
- Why: +1 bonus for 10/10 games (common for big men)
- Target: Centers averaging 10+ points and 10+ rebounds

### Specific Recommendations (To be populated after projection analysis)

Once player projections complete, we'll identify:
1. Top 5 undervalued players (high projection, likely low Sorare price)
2. Best budget limited cards by position
3. Consistent scorers with low variance
4. Players with favorable schedules (weak opponents, home games)

## Lineup Construction Guidelines

### Limited Champion League (5 Limited Cards)
**Optimal Strategy**:
1. **Anchor**: One elite limited card (35+ average score)
2. **Core**: Two solid starters (25-30 average)
3. **Value**: Two high-floor budget cards (20+ average)

**Position Balance**: Aim for at least one elite rebounder (center) + one high-assist guard

**Risk Management**: Mix one boom-or-bust player with four consistent scorers

### Common League (5 Common Cards)
- Prioritize high minutes guys
- Target volume scorers (points + rebounds + assists)
- Avoid bench players with unpredictable minutes

## Market Inefficiencies to Exploit

1. **Backup Centers on Bad Teams**
   - High minutes, lots of rebounds
   - Often cheap because team is losing

2. **Newly Traded Players**
   - Market hasn't adjusted to new role/minutes
   - Can find steals if they moved to starting role

3. **Post-Injury Bargains**
   - Players returning from injury often underpriced
   - Wait 3-5 games to confirm health

4. **Defensive Specialists**
   - Market undervalues steals/blocks
   - Our scoring system rewards them heavily (3.0 each)
