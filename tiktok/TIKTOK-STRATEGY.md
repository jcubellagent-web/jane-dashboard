# TikTok Strategy Guide 2025/2026

## Best Posting Times
- **US audience**: 7-9 AM, 12-1 PM, 7-10 PM EST
- **Peak days**: Tuesday, Thursday, Friday
- **Test**: Try 2 different time slots daily for a week, compare engagement
- Post 3-5x per week minimum for consistency

## Hashtag Strategy (3-5 per video)
Mix large + niche tags:
- **Large**: #fyp #foryou #ai #tech #viral
- **Niche**: #aiagent #mfer #cryptoai #aipersonality #digitalagent
- **Trending**: Check TikTok Creative Center for current trends
- Don't overstuff — 3-5 hashtags is optimal (per Buffer 2026)

## Hook Timing (First 1-3 Seconds = CRITICAL)
- First frame must grab attention — text on screen immediately
- Open with a bold/controversial statement or question
- Visual movement in first second (animation, text pop)
- TikTok measures watch-through rate heavily — if people skip in first 2 sec, video dies
- Pattern interrupt: unexpected visual or statement

## Optimal Video Length
- **Sweet spot**: 30-60 seconds for storytelling content
- **Under 15 sec**: good for punchy jokes/memes
- **Over 60 sec**: only if retention stays high
- TikTok rewards completion rate — shorter videos that get rewatched > long videos that get skipped
- Our target: 25-40 seconds (fast TTS helps)

## Engagement Tactics
- **Reply to comments with video** — algorithm loves this
- **End with a question or CTA** — drives comments
- **Use on-screen text + subtitles** — most users watch without sound
- **Trending sounds** — even at low volume, helps discoverability
- **Post consistently** — 3-5x/week minimum
- **Engage in first 30 min** after posting — reply to every comment
- **Stitch/Duet** trending content in your niche
- **Series content** — "Part 1, Part 2" hooks viewers to follow
