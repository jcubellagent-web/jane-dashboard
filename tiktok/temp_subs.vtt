00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,636
This is a quality test for the upgraded TikTok video generator.

2
00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:07,920
We're testing proper text margins that respect both left and right boundaries.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,715
No text should ever fall off the screen edges.

4
00:00:10,715 --> 00:00:15,590
We're also testing smooth scrolling text animation, like a teleprompter or movie credits.

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:20,193
The text should scroll upward smoothly rather than cramming everything on screen at once.

6
00:00:20,193 --> 00:00:22,628
And finally, we have background music.

7
00:00:22,628 --> 00:00:25,822
A subtle lo-fi beat generated with ffmpeg.

8
00:00:25,822 --> 00:00:27,738
The video should not be silent.

9
00:00:27,738 --> 00:00:31,579
These improvements make the videos much more professional and engaging.

10
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:33,465
Font sizes are readable.

11
00:00:33,465 --> 00:00:35,136
Transitions are clean.

12
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:37,715
And everything stays within safe margins.

13
00:00:37,715 --> 00:00:40,568
This is what quality TikTok content looks like.

14
00:00:40,568 --> 00:00:42,534
Thank you for watching this test.
