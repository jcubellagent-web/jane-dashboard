🏢 AI IMPACT ON ENTERPRISE SaaS

Tracking ALL public statements by large software companies quantifying AI's impact — revenue attribution, productivity gains, cost savings, headcount changes, AI bookings, customer adoption metrics, and forward guidance tied to AI.

**COMPANIES TO TRACK** (not limited to these — include ANY large software company making quantified AI impact statements):
▸ $CRM (Salesforce): Agentforce metrics, AI revenue, workforce restructuring numbers
▸ $NOW (ServiceNow): AI bookings, Now Assist adoption, AI-attributed revenue
▸ $WDAY (Workday): AI monetization figures, customer adoption rates
▸ $PLTR (Palantir): AIP revenue, commercial customer growth, AI contract values
▸ $DUOL (Duolingo): AI-driven content creation efficiency, cost savings from AI
▸ $MSFT (Microsoft): Copilot revenue/adoption, Azure AI growth numbers
▸ $GOOG (Google): Gemini enterprise adoption, Cloud AI revenue
▸ $ADBE (Adobe): Firefly usage stats, AI feature revenue impact
▸ $INTU (Intuit): AI-assisted tax/accounting metrics
▸ $SNOW (Snowflake), $MDB (MongoDB), $DDOG (Datadog), $TEAM (Atlassian), etc.

**PRIORITIZE**: Earnings calls, investor days, press releases, analyst notes, CEO/CFO quotes that put SPECIFIC NUMBERS on AI impact (e.g., "$X billion in AI bookings", "Y% productivity gain", "reduced headcount by Z through AI")
